## Tier List

A fun take on a [tier list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tier_list) for books.

Originally I was just going to import my 5/5 rated books, but that's too many so I give you my all time favorites by category. S-tier only.

## Biographies / History

Both auto-biographical and historical non-fiction

Books I've read that helped me learn skills to transisiton from an engineer to a leader
