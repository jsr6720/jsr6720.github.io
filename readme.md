If I'm still paying for it also hosted at [https://jsrowe.com](https://www.jsrowe.com)

## Tags

Decided not to use ```Category``` as its the same as tags but jekyll uses it in its url which I overrode anyways.

Primarily tagging by language and whatever I might need to find things again

- TIL (today I learned) / I find this interesting
- coding lanaguge, i.e. javascript, shell, python etcetera
- coding framework i.e. React, Spring Boot, Xcode

Some companion tags

- technology
- architecture
- programming (engineering)
- personal (musings)
- business
- management
- career
- books
- reviews
- tools
- framework


### Book Review tags

A bit more comprehensive and aligned with the 'shelves' in goodreads

Primary shelf IN (read, reading, want to read, did not finish)

Book tags (might be some overlap from above)

- pyschology
- personal-development
- fantasy
- business (what a business is)
- management (what it takes to run a business)
- leadership (what it takes to be a leader)
- biography (usually covers a primary person)
- history (usually covers events)
- non-fiction
- fiction
