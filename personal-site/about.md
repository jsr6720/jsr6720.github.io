## Bio

Hi! I'm James Rowe and I'm an engineer at heart. I've built software in a range of technologies and companies and I wanted a place to share what I've learned along the way while still maintaining ownership and flexibility of markdown -> published content.

## Why a public GitHub site?

I've used authoring platforms before and I tired of auto format updates, lack of data clarity and other small friction points along the way. This is my site, there are many like it, but this one is mine.

Having seen the web grow from late 90s to present I like the idea of a simple mechanism to publish thoughts with the most advanced site feature an [atom feed](/feed.xml).
