# Whitepapers Readme

I like to read whitepapers, but often I either print them out and mark them up or forget where to find them. This will be my digital archive of things I read online that power discussions. Maybe.. Always trying new things.

Most. Definitely going to keep more. I keep reading something and can't find it again. So annoying.

Ok so you caught me. Not really a whitepaper. But one of the benefits working from is disabusing my children that I do anything exciting beyond sign fancy documents with fancy logos. And isn't that worth preserving? I think Maddie was the representative owner of the team that day.

May I forever live up to the ideals of: Strength, Commitment, Productivity, Support and Partnership
