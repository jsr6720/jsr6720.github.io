# Draft Ideas

Post Ideas. Write them down before they're gone

1. one year with aws "Free Tier"
2. staying current with technical skills
3. the future of SDLC. How will AI improve things? break things?
    a. https://harper.blog/2025/02/16/my-llm-codegen-workflow-atm/

    scene from armegeddon where smart crew dismantles rocket
4. project - jekyll plugin/rake task that aggregates all outbound domains as a reference sheet
5. how i DON"T use AI everyday

right tool for the job metaphor. if all you have is a hammer then everything looks like a nail
6. n-1 communication channels
7. what makes for a great engineer
8. macroecnomics of entry level roles for software engineering

9. The Grapes of Wrath of Software Engineering
- AI automation
- trajectory of trained CS graduates
- macroeconomic global forces (the world is flat)
- trends in farmers did not match trends in population growth, there's another factor, technology

10. AI is all about the big T skills model. AI can help broading grasp breadth, but cannot penetrate depth

11. building on the big T. mirroring of skills

(maybe quad matrix) -> or meme about bell curve
- you know -> helps get things done, but can be in the way
- you don't know -> frustrating, combined with hallluciations can cause more frustration
- you kinda know -> sweet spot. gets you going and unstuck, but don't completely solve everything

Use prompting to compare to existing knowledge. like I know how jekyll works. compare hugo. 
or I know how jenkins works compare github actions
