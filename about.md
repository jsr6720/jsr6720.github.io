Hi! I'm James, and I've been a student of delivering solutions via software for over 20 years in a variety of industries. I have experience as a software engineer, software architect, and people leader with a wide range of technologies. Right now I’m building better car insurance [@Clearcover](https://www.linkedin.com/company/clearcover-inc/).

Previously I’ve worked in manufacturing, finance, and healthcare. I wanted a place to publish and share what I've learned along my journey; this is that place.

Find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jsr6720){:target="_blank"} or check out my [publications](https://www.roweinnovations.com/publications/). [Send me an email](mailto:jrowe6720@gmail.com)

## Working

A candid photo taken by my kids that I feel captures how I frequently find myself "at work" on my personal projects—complete with help from a lemur. Very serious business.

## Privacy

- No Google Analytics, Microsoft Clarity, or similar JS trackers. (At one point I had setup an account, but never analyzed the data)
- No cookies, beacons, pixels, heatmaps, or session replay.
- I don’t sell, share, or monetize visitor data. Period.
- My hosting provider (AWS) may keep standard server logs (e.g., IP, user-agent, timestamps).

Did something here save you time? Help you? Entertain you? Consider whether all that is worth a cup of coffee, at least until I can directly plug my AWS invoice here.
