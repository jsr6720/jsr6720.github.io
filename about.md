## Bio

Hi! I'm James Rowe and I'm an engineer at heart. I've built software in a range of technologies and companies and I wanted a place to share what I've learned along the way.

## Why a public GitHub site?

Having used WYSIWYG authoring platforms like Wordpress, blogspot and roll-your-own implementations of Drupal and Joomla I grew tired of the clumsy UIs and lack of version control I was used to writing code. Combined with lack of data transparency and other small friction points along the way I decided to [revisit the markdown to static site generators](/articles/hello-world-jekyll/).

Having seen the web grow from late 90s to present I like the idea of a simple build process to publish static content with some basic functionality like an [atom feed](/feed.xml). This is my site, there are many like it, but this one is mine.

## Basic web tracking

Implemented using GDRP compliant functionality. Just a way to understand what is being read.

## Support

Did something here save you time? Help you? Entertain? Consider all that for a cup of coffee, at least until I can direct plug my AWS invoice here.
