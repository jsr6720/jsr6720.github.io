## Short Bio

Hi! I'm James and I'm an engineer at heart. I've been a student of the business of software engineering products for over 20 years. I have experience with a wide range of technologies and worked in a variety of industries. I wanted a place to share what I've learned along the way, this is that place.

## A mind at work

A candid photo taken by my kids that I feel captures how I find myself "at work" on my personal projects. Complete with help from a lemur. Very serious business.

## Why a Jekyll site?

Having used WYSIWYG authoring platforms like Wordpress, blogspot and roll-your-own implementations of Drupal and Joomla. I grew tired of the bulky UIs and lack of version control work process I was accustomed to with writing code. I just want to open a file, write my content and see it on screen.

This combined with lack of data transparency and other small friction points along the way I decided to [revisit the markdown to static site generators](/hello-world-jekyll/) and found a lot of personal satisfaction with GitHub Pages/Jekyll authoring and publishing.

Having seen the web grow from late 90s to present I really liked the idea of a writing-focused experienced combined with a simple build process to publish static content with some basic functionality like an [atom feed](/feed.xml). This is my site, [there are many like it](/inspiration.md), but this one is mine.

## FYI Basic web tracking

TBD - But with intent to implement using GDRP compliant functionality, ie [web counter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_counter). Right now I have no idea if anyone is reading. And that's ok.

One of my favorite thought pieces. [Are you really leading, or are you just taking a walk?](https://www.johnmaxwell.com/blog/are-you-really-leading-or-are-you-just-taking-a-walk/) Writing and putting my works 'out there' is half the endeavor. Seeing what is meeting a need is another.
