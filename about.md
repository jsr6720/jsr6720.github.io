## About James Rowe

Hi! I'm James, and I've been a student of delivering solutions via software for over 20 years in a variety of industries. I have experience as a software engineer, software architect, and people leader with a wide range of technologies. Right now I’m transforming insurance [@Clearcover]( https://www.linkedin.com/company/clearcover-inc/).

Previously I’ve worked in manufacturing, finance, and healthcare. I wanted a place to publish and share what I've learned along my journey; this is that place.

A candid photo taken by my kids that I feel captures how I frequently find myself "at work" on my personal projects—complete with help from a lemur. Very serious business.
