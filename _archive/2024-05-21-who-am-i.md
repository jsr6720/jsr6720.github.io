## A short history on handles

In the early days of the internet (circa 1990s) there was no concept of shared social site user identities let alone cookies that followed us all throughout the web. But who am I (online)? Slightly inspired by [xkcd 2363 Message Boards](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/2363:_Message_Boards).

## My first username

`zeus_ruler_1`

Prevailing wisdom(?) was to create a memorable username without identifying information. I want to say this was 1997/1998 (7th grade?) which according to [Pew](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2007/06/21/the-internet-circa-1998/) the internet already had ~150million users.

I was taking some type of mythology class in middle school and landed on a combination of "zeus is ruler number 1". I used this well into high school on a variety of sites but primarily yahoo games where I would play hearts and as an email address (`zeus_ruler_1@yahoo.com`).

I tried to knock on the doors of yahoo and it seems that at some point I had a jump.net email address I had completely forgotten about.

## A roadrunner account

I speculate that during this time my first email provider was either `hotmail` or perhaps `roadrunner`. I tried password recovering to no avail. I would guess I used `jrowe@austin.rr.com` address, but who knows.

## AIM/AOL messenger

But also MSN messenger and ICQ

For AOL instant messenger I remember trying to find something with my name in it and settling on `jamesthe3000th` out of frustration how many combinations of james were already taken. I also used this handle for a number of years into college.

## Joining gmail

My first gmail was my full name and then later `jsr6720`. Both of which I deleted along the way of various different frustrations with data privacy and just a general desire to try other services. But at this point I'm back once again. I didn't get in during the beta but would have signed up in the 2005-2008 time frame.

## RIT Assigned id

At college I was issued a userid of `jsr6720` and this moniker has stuck in some form over the past 15 years. I've had to prefix with `jsrowe` or `jrowe` to meet some username restrictions but I would guess most combinations are me. Not quite the bellow of [`2-4-6-0-1`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Valjean) but its mine.

## Battle.net/Blizzard

Diablo, World of Warcraft and `battle.net` were the great online gaming expanses in high school/college. I tried to see what emails I had registered but no luck. For some of these online rpg games I signed up as `sirsparhawk` after the character in the David Eddings books. No points granted for my character class of choice.

## My first "professional brand"

`txcowboycoder`

At my first job I kept finding interesting things I wanted to share and published them on my now locked txcowboycoder site. I had created a [gravatar](https://gravatar.com/txcowboycoder) as well. No clue what happened to all these logins over time.

Unfortunately I set this up around what turned out to be considered an anti-pattern in my profession. Oh well. It looks like I had also registered a domain `codedeputy.com` for some short period of time as well. Likely with `bluehost` or `1and1` hosting?

I tried to extend this to be helpful on `stackoverflow` but I only submitted a few answers before not finding a good fit.

## King and his court

Full credit to the [King and his court softball team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Feigner), but for some family accounts this was an easy way for me to remember.

By now most sites use some form of email login which all tie back to RIT/gmail. At least until `neurolink` takes over I suppose.

Let's just say the internet is for cats.

##### Author's Note

Immediately filed in `_archive` as it was fun to reminisce, but nothing I want to publish. But also all mostly public information.

I think whats interesting is that I can't "find" any of the above usernames via search, but often will come up in data breach searches and other "dark web" search results. Even if its just login key/value pairs.
