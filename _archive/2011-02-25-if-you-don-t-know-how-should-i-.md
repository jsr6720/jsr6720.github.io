## If you don’t know, how should I?


So my writing is rarely proof read and is likely full of errors. However I should think there would be a way to write a script that would parse web pages checking for errors.


Heck maybe even a HTML scrapper that took the generated content and ran it through spell check. Sure you’d have to do it for every conceivable browser/OS combo out there, but I would think there is a way to get to 95% or 97% coverage.


See the example below.
