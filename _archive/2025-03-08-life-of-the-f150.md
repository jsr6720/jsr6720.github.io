## In it for the Long Haul

I feel silly eulogizing this F150, but after 11 years as my daily driver and primary vehicle it didn't feel right to just let it go. I bought this truck on March 3rd, 2014 and I'm trading it in March 11th, 2025. It has outlasted every single other vehicle I've had.

I don't remember how much I put down, 8k? 5% APR? but the original note was for $24,802 dollars and was paid off October 2019.

At the time of purchase it had 51,133 miles. Upon retiring it has 162k.

I was only able to find the following expenses in my folder. This truck was so reliable and hauled everything for all the years of home remodeling projects. While it was a pavement princess, the bed carried lumber, tile, drywall, plywood, straw/hay, feed, fertilizer, dirt, furniture, equipment and so much more.

The math says that this lifetime (110k miles) ownership was $.32 cents a mile (excluding consumables). Quite an accomplishment.
