## What’s a “sie”?


Seriously [NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/external/venturebeat/2011/03/14/14venturebeat-4chan-hackers-leak-internal-bank-of-america-39020.html?partner=rss&emc=rss)? I guess it’s hard to type “site” three times in two sentences.



> The site created a stir among world governments, who have denounced the site’s actions, and it was booted by its domain name service provider EveryDNS. Assange and the **sie** also had their accounts suspended
