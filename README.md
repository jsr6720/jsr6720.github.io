## Where did all the stuff come from pre-init date

Mostly [goodreads.com reviews](https://github.com/jsr6720/goodreads-csv-to-md) and [an old wordpress website](https://github.com/jsr6720/wordpress-html-scraper-to-md) aka [txcowboycoder](https://txcowboycoder.wordpress.com)

## Category && Tags

Category. I did end up deciding to use categories even though behind the scenes it maps to a tag.

Primarily tagging by language and whatever I might need to find things again

- coding lanaguge, i.e. javascript, shell, python etcetera
- coding framework i.e. React, Spring Boot, Xcode

Some tags I've copied from above pre-init sites:

- technology
- architecture
- programming (engineering)
- personal (musings)
- business
- management
- career
- books
- reviews
- tools
- framework

### Book Review tags

A bit more comprehensive and aligned with the 'shelves' in Goodreads

Primary shelf IN (read, reading, want to read, did not finish)

Book tags (might be some overlap from above)

- psychology
- personal-development
- fantasy
- business (what a business is)
- management (what it takes to run a business)
- leadership (what it takes to be a leader)
- biography (usually covers a primary person)
- history (usually covers events)
- non-fiction
- fiction

# Inspiration

Sites that inspire me for both their content and design. It's not that these sites are better than the rest, but that when I first started on restarting my writing these were the ones I thought of first.
