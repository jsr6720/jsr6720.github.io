## Where did all the stuff come from pre-init date

Mostly [goodreads.com reviews](https://github.com/jsr6720/goodreads-csv-to-md) and [an old wordpress website](https://github.com/jsr6720/wordpress-html-scraper-to-md) aka [txcowboycoder](https://txcowboycoder.wordpress.com)

### Book Review tags

A bit more comprehensive and aligned with the 'shelves' in Goodreads

Primary shelf IN (read, reading, want to read, did not finish)

Book tags (might be some overlap from above)

- psychology
- personal-development
- fantasy
- business (what a business is)
- management (what it takes to run a business)
- leadership (what it takes to be a leader)
- biography (usually covers a primary person)
- history (usually covers events)
- non-fiction
- fiction

# Inspiration

Sites that inspire me for both their content and design. It's not that these sites are better than the rest, but that when I first started on restarting my writing these were the ones I thought of first. 1000% Bonus points for the inclusion of a `feed.xml`.

<https://simonwillison.net> which is also hosted as a `public` GitHub repository here <https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog>

<https://posthaven.com> SubStack and Medium have all gone the paywall route. This site hasn't as of yet, and its focus is on longevity.
