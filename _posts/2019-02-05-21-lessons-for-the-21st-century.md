Yuval Noah Harari, *[21 Lessons for the 21st Century](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39025805)*,  Random House Audio 2018 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="0525639853"

## My Review 4/5

Depressing book. Life is just a swirl of Neurons firing and everything is a story refuted by science. 

Not a list of skills but a collection of  thoughts of the future and how knowing thyself is the best protection against the algorithms.
