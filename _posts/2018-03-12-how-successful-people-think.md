John C. Maxwell, *[How Successful People Think: Change Your Thinking, Change Your Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6012533)*,  Center Street 2009 (Hardcover) ISBN: ="1599951681"

## My Review 3/5

Solid book on the practices of thinking by successful people. Number one lesson to take away is that great achievers put forethought into their plans.

Maxwell has great leadership books. I missed that this was excerpted from a larger work and it shows. It's a reflection on different though habits and how best to match your personality to a specific habit. Things like, set a routine, or be prepared. Moving on to his much more acclaimed "5 Levels of Leadership" book
