### Feature Request: return UUID in canonical form (no hyphens)

4D v12 has a new function [Generate UUID](http://doc.4d.com/4D-Language-Reference-12/Tools/Generate-UUID.301-186324.en.html)[^1] This is a much welcome feature, but fails to return an UUID in canonical (with hyphens) form like everyone else[^2].

It would appear that 4D has UUIDs for everything it stores internally[^3]. 4D has no comment on why it has chosen to have `Generate UUID` return a UUID without hyphens.

Further, in v12 using the “UUID format” on an alpha field removes the capability to set the length of said field. If I copy a UUID with hyphens, it strips them out to save them to 32 length string.

4D says there is no benefit, other than convenience, from having an UUID field and a 36 char alpha field with a trigger that stores UUID via `Generate UUID` into it.

Finally, the documentation says to refer to the design reference manual for v12 for more information. Which isn’t out as of the time of this writing.

### A decade in reflection

**note:** revisiting this feature request nearly 15 years years later is surreal. Good news. `4D` now returns either in canonical and non-canonical forms.

The word of software has moved forward tremendously in 15 years and I think documentation and forums have benefitted the most? Maybe? I suppose "It'll go on the backlog.." has its own special place.

Don't worry `4D`, you still hold a special place in my heart.
