John M. Gottman, *[The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work: A Practical Guide from the Country's Foremost Relationship Expert](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10650408)*, Nan Silver, John Allen Nelson Tantor Audio 2011 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1452601518"

## My Review 5/5

Great book with lots of functional examples and test for 'scoring' a marriage.

Key is a solid friendship that can weather the storm of life.

Learn to respect each other's differences and move past gridlock issues. Will definitely pick up again,

need physical book to copy some of the exercises.
