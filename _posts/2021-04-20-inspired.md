Marty Cagan, *[Inspired: How to Create Tech Products Customers Love](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35249663)*,  Wiley 2017 (Hardcover) ISBN: 1119387507

## My Review 5/5

Great book, especially for a product leader at a technology company. Read about half the book and put it down (did not finish). A bit repetitive.
