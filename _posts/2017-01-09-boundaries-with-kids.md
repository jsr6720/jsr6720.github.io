## My Review 5/5

Picked this up because it's the only audio book by [Henry Cloud](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1114699) at my library and as an extension of the lessons from [Active Parenting Now](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1343214)<br/><br/>The introduction details how this a book of how to love your children and provide an environment for them to be successful in life. Actions as parents ultimately help shape our children's character. Make sure constantly modeling good behavior and words.<br/><br/>Regardless of it's scripture heavy references the lessons about parenting are solid. The ultimate goal is to parent your way of a job. Role of a parent is to provide limits and boundaries that expand as kids grow older to match society's boundaries.<br/><br/>Some important steps are keeping written commitments (chore lists) and letting the child choose from a painful and pleasurable outcome that is age appropriate. IE Give your child the choice of which coat to wear, green or blue, but not of whether or not to wear a coat. Expect your child to constantly push boundaries and test their limits. It's the parent's job to be consistent firm and fair.<br/><br/>Good book.<br/><br/>
