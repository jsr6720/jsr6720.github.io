Jessica Joelle Alexander, *[The Danish Way of Parenting: What the Happiest People in the World Know About Raising Confident, Capable Kids](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28815322)*, Iben Sandahl TarcherPerigee 2016 (Paperback) ISBN: ="014311171X"

## My Review 4/5

Of course happy families are all alike. And unhappy ones each in their own way.
