Don Malarkey, *[Easy Company Soldier: The Legendary Battles of a Sergeant from World War II's "Band of Brothers"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3835022)*, Bob Welch Macmillan Audio 2008 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1427204500"

## My Review 5/5

Great companion to Conversations with Major Dick Winters. Covers some of the same era. If Dick Winters is the boy scout then Malarkey is the Shop Class Hero.
