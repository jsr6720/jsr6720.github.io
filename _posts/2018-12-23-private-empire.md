Steve Coll, *[Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13588080)*, Malcolm Hillgartner Penguin Audio 2012 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1611760720"

## My Review 4/5

Long. Detailed. History of Exxon mobile from its birth out of the standard oil breakup. This book covers the key players including brief Secretary of State Rex tillerson. <br/><br/>At 18 cds broke this into two readings but covers the entire globe. Almost a collection of short stories based on location.
