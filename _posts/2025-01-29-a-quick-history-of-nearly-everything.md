Bryson, Bill. *[A Short History of Nearly Everything](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3112496-a-short-history-of-nearly-everything)*. Penguin Random House Audio Publishing Group, 2006. Audiobook. ISBN 9780739375617 (ISBN10: 073937561X). 


## My Review 4/5

A very easy, approachable listen on mostly science knowledge up until publication year 2003. From an inspection of the universe and the very large, to an understanding of atoms and the very small; this book covers a lot of core science concepts in a short format. I like that Bryson tried to give accolades to the hundreds of scientist that aren't readily remembered, but I think the only takeaway I have is if you want to be scientifically remembered have a constant named for yourself. Be like [Planck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant) or [Avogadro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avogadro_constant).

Another keen observation, every time humanity decides "Yes, we have discovered everything there is to know about *subject*." It turns out that just behind a curtain of understanding are entire fields of study. For example, the book details how before the theory of plate tectonics and continental drift (which explained how sea fossils ended up on mountain tops or millions of miles apart), land bridges were conveniently inserted on every portion of the globe that "explained" how species to traversed great distances.

It is actually a great framing to understand why so much of science is a *theory* and not fact. For there is so very little that we can say is factual. I think I'm left with two very distinct feelings. One, how amazing is the happy accident of my existence, my immense collection of borrowed atoms and dna at the culmination of now. Two, if this truly is it, better make the most of it.
