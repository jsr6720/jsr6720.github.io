Ron Wallace, *[Leadership Lessons from a UPS Driver: Delivering a Culture of We, Not Me](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28158907)*,  Berrett-Koehler on Dreamscape Audio 2016 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1520005008"

## My Review 5/5

Great collection of business stories that help drive the culture of UPS.

This is definitely a "Management by walking around" approach and reflects the disperse nature of the organization. Short and to the point there are many great pieces of advice here.
