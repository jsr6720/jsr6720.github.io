## Slider bar for zoom level


4Dv12 has a magnifying glass and preset zoom levels (50, 100, 200, 400, 800) to aid in designing forms. However, more fine tuned controls would aid in the design of complex and large forms.

Just a whimsical wish that I could zoom to something other than the presets. Even the magnifying glass doesn’t custom zoom, only zooms to the next or previous (with shift key) ‘level’ on the scale.
