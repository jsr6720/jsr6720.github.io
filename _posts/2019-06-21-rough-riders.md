Mark Lee Gardner, *[Rough Riders: Theordore Roosevelt, His Cowboy Regiment, and the Immortal Charge Up San Juan Hill](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29445916)*, Danny Campbell HarperCollins 2016 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1504732669"

## My Review 5/5

While it must be tough to separate the story of the Rough Riders from such a large figure in american history (Roosevelt). This book does a good job staying in the narrative of the Rough Riders formation, voyage and fighting spirit.
