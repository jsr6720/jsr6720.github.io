Paul Vigna, *[The Age of Cryptocurrency: How Bitcoin and Digital Money Are Challenging the Global Economic Order](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22174460)*, Michael J. Casey St. Martin's Press 2015 (Hardcover) ISBN: ="1250065631"

## My Review 3/5

I picked this book because I felt out of touch with all the block chain technologies out there. This book did a good job covering the foundation of fiat currencies and the future of digital ones.

However, be aware that this book covers much more ground that Bitcoin itself. It will be interesting to see how digital currencies play out. Reminded me of the stories in [Business Adventures: Twelve Classic Tales from the World of Wall Street](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22710212)
