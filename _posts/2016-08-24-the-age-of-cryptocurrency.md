## My Review 3/5

I picked this book because I felt out of touch with all the block chain technologies out there. This book did a good job covering the foundation of fiat currencies and the future of digital ones.<br/><br/>However, be aware that this book covers much more ground that Bitcoin itself. It will be interesting to see how digital currencies play out. Reminded me of the stories in [Business Adventures: Twelve Classic Tales from the World of Wall Street](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22710212)
