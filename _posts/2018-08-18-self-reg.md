Stuart Shanker, *[Self-Reg](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28012931)*,  Books on Tape 2016 (Paperback) ISBN: ="0451486773"

## My Review 2/5

Entire book can be summarized: You cannot parent effectively unless you are calm. Look to the environment for stressors, you must wait for a teachable moment to teach a lesson.<br/><br/>There is a LOT of science here, but nothing directly applicable. Far superior books were [The Collapse of Parenting](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25273812) or [Boundaries with Kids](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104887)
