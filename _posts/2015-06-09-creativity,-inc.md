Ed Catmull, *[Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077873)*, Amy    Wallace Random House Audio 2014 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="0804127441"

## My Review 1/5

Couldn't finish. History of Pixar was interesting, but failed to deliver an engaging experience.

To clarify, it's not bad, its just not for me.
