David McCullough, *[John Adams](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2203)*,  Simon & Schuster Paperbacks 2001 (Paperback) ISBN: ="0743223136"

## My Review 5/5

Amazing. The life of John Adams is certainly overlooked as a founding father. Could not be happier.<br/><br/>Narrative of a strong man whose defining characteristic was New England purity and integrity.<br/>Jon Adams was the defense attorney for the British soldiers from the Boston massacre, did more to advance the independence cause in congress than any other member. <br/><br/>Founder of the navy and first father-son presidential pair. So many good lessons from his life.
