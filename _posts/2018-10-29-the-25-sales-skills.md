Stephan Schiffman, *[The 25 Sales Skills: They Don't Teach at Business School](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18568483)*,  Brilliance Audio 2014 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1480572179"

## My Review 3/5

Quick top hitting inter-personal things to watch for while making sales relationships.<br/>Emphasizes that even in today's ultra electronic world it's still 'know your customer' and build a relationship of solving problems.<br/><br/>Best tip I liked was "be righted". Make small mistakes in front of prospects to be corrected and gain valuable information while allowing the prospect a chance to feel superior.
