Thomas L. Friedman, *[Hot, Flat, and Crowded: Why We Need a Green Revolution and How It Can Renew America](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2358738)*, Oliver Wyman Macmillan Audio 2008 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1427204586"

## My Review 2/5

This book takes WAY too long to say a few points. Could not finish, it felt like I was listening to the same chapters over and over again.

* Population growth is exponential (Crowded)

* Science has determined that consuming fuels from hell is bad (Hot)

* Globalization means there are fewer and fewer virgin resources to exploit for growth (Flat)
