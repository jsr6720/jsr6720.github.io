Erik Larson, *[Isaac's Storm: A Man, a Time, and the Deadliest Hurricane in History](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2169230)*, Edward Herrmann Random House Audio 2006 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="0739340360"

## My Review 3/5

Good. Actually quite sad towards the end on account of detail description of death and loss of life.<br/>The twin story telling of Isaac's life and the storm build up was confusing.<br/><br/>Should review basic Texas geography before listening.<br/>Sparked an interest in the weather bureau though...
