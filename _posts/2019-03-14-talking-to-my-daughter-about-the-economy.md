Yanis Varoufakis, *[Talking to my Daughter about the Economy: or, How Capitalism Works--and How It Fails](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36482374)*,  Macmillan Audio 2018 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1250296978"

## My Review 3/5

In a word. Economist are closer to astrologist than astronomers.<br/>There exist no way to test in isolation specific economic policies so it's important to be a part of the conversation.<br/><br/>Covers the most high level of concepts and uses pop-culture and of course Greek mythology to tell his daughter about how the world works to concentrate wealth while leaving abject poverty in its wake.<br/><br/>Silly side note. The author epitomizes the dad from "My Big Fat Greek Wedding". 'Give me any word and I will tell you the greek root word'. Not a distraction just funny.
