## My Review 4/5

Leadership 101 - repeat of prev. listed. Still a great listen.<br/>Relationships 101 - People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care<br/>Attitude 101 - Being positive is infectious. Need the most positive attitude to succeed<br/>Mentoring 101 - Bring with you the right people to succeed. Don't leave roadblocks in the path of others<br/>Equipping 101 - give your followers/leaders the right mindset, not just the right tools<br/>Success 101 - repeat of the various other chapters<br/>Self-Improvement 101 - always sharpen the saw<br/>Teamwork 101 - repeat of the above but in a team setting<br/><br/>While I wouldn't recommend going through all of these in one sitting, they are great one-off reads.
