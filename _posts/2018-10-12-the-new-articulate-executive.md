Granville Toogood, *[The New Articulate Executive: Look, Act and Sound Like a Leader](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8771103)*,  McGraw-Hill Education 2010 (Hardcover) ISBN: ="007174326X"

## My Review 4/5

A quick read and chapters are separated by section. IE 'presenting on TV' or 'Use of teleprompters'.

Key takeaways for me:

* No lecture/presentation can go past 18 minutes without re-engaging the audience

* Start with the summary and projections forward, work down to the details

* Present a thin, streamlined power point (wafer) and provide documentation after (whopper)

Only 3 bullet points because apparently humans like odd numbers.
