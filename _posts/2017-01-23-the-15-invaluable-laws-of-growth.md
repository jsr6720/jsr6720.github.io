## My Review 5/5

This is a great read. On par as an shorter version of [Think and Grow Rich](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30186948). Far too much to retain in one reading here are some key points:<br/><br/>* Always have a beginner's mindset<br/>* Stay curious to the world around you<br/>* Never stop growing<br/>* Life begins at the edge of our comfort zone
