John C. Maxwell, *[The 15 Invaluable Laws of Growth: Live Them and Reach Your Potential](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13526312)*,  Center Street 2012 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1607885182"

## My Review 5/5

This is a great read. On par as an shorter version of [Think and Grow Rich](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30186948). Far too much to retain in one reading here are some key points:

* Always have a beginner's mindset

* Stay curious to the world around you

* Never stop growing

* Life begins at the edge of our comfort zone
