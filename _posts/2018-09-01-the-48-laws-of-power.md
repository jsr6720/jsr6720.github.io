Robert Greene, *[The 48 Laws of Power](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1170150)*, Don Leslie HighBridge Audio 2007 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1598870920"

## My Review 5/5

This book contains the hard truths of the habits and mannerism of people who don't play nice. Full of excerpts from history, antiqued and modern, you'd be a fool to not know these tricks.<br/><br/>Great read.
