## 4D text interpolation


For text string building I am very fond of phpâ€™s interpolate feature:




| 1234 | `# my variable``$name` `=` `"Joe Bob"``;``# my command``$my_sentence` `=` `"Hello {$name}!"``;` |
| --- | --- |


In 4D the same can be accomplished with text objects.



```
`have a table [Table]full_name
` this is the typed string for the text
` notice the "<" and ">" enclosing the field reference
vt_object:="Hello <[Table]full_name>!"
` outputs "Hello Joe Bob!" assuming that was what was loaded in the record

```
