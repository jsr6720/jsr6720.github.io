## My Review 4/5

Good solid quick reading covering some of the practical applications of popular-psychology to work habits. As I finished the book, I was left with the perception that the book was about twice as long as it needed to be. The first half of the book delves into some of the ways that original thinkers approach problem solving. But not all is lost. I did learn some new concepts and studies that I hadn't heard before.

### 4 Responses to a Challenge

I learned from *Inside Out* and various books (*Who Moved My Cheese*, *Our Iceberg Is Melting*) that there are emotional responses to challenges, but this book also highlighted responses to a challenge that adds perspective to the outcomes.

* Exit - Leave the system
* Voice - Try and change the system
* Persistence - Endure the system (malicious compliance?)
* Neglect - Ignore

Irrespective of originally understanding this framework for sorting through the rush of actions in the face of a challenging situation was useful.

### Mental Models

Have a balanced risk portfolio and leaving things unfinished. Its ok to extend yourself and take risks, but just like poker those risks can be applied intelligently or recklessly. Also that leaving things unfinished and in your mind can engage deeper thought on it. Thoughtful procrastination can spur innovation.

Now I have a reason to leave things to the very last minute. I'm getting my juices going!
