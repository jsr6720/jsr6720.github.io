John Brooks, *[Business Adventures: Twelve Classic Tales from the World of Wall Street](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22747981)*,  Random House Audio 2014 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1101913320"

## My Review 4/5

As famously recommended by Bill Gates and Warren Buffet, this was a very entertaining read. In fact I wish there were a modern version. Two things struck me, the way I consume news is author independent. I should change this. Finding a good author like Malcolm Gladwell, John Covey, or Jim Collins is just as important as reading the 'highlight' real of best books.

The story that stuck with me most was "Xerox Xerox Xerox" and the story of the "Edsel" Ford brand. Xerox because I now work in Webster, the 'cow town' that xerox was setting up headquarters in 1960s.

This book, I think is far more relevant to those who lived through the time period. Identifying with the subject matter is important.
