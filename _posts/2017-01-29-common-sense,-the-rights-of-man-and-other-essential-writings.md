Thomas Paine, *[Common Sense, The Rights of Man and Other Essential Writings](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/99955)*, Jack Fruchtman Jr., Sidney Hook Signet 2003 (Paperback) ISBN: ="0451528891"

## My Review 4/5

Great read to fill in some of the thoughts prior to the revolution. Funny how in 250 years politics still hasn't changed. Those who disagree with Paine are fools. 

Personally read as part of becks book.
