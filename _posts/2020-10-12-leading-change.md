John P. Kotter, *[Leading Change](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51370)*,  Harvard Business School Pr 1996 (Audiobook) ISBN: ="0875847471"

## My Review 5/5

This is a comprehensive blueprint for leading change in an organization. It details the difference between being a manager and being a leader. One is title based, anyone can be a leader. Communication underpins all of the phases to changes, and it can take years to establish a measurable culture shift.

Great book for anyone who is responsible for leading change at any level of the organization.
