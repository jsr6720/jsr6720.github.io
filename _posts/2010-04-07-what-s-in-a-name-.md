## What’s in a name?[^draft]

I’m here cracking into the crowed field of programming blogs. Maybe I’ll learn to write more concisely, or even improve my spelling.

Though mainly, I thought I would start something that I could collect my thoughts on problems that I have found a solution to.

Other times I might just post something unrelated to programming for conversation’s sake.

What’s in a name? I currently work in an environment where bugs and problems crop up like bad guys in [High Noon](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044706/). Even if one day I work in a different environment, cowboy coding to me is some of the most exciting and frustrating work with programming.

Whether it’s looking a new languages or exploring different tools, every problem could benefit from a revolver full of ideas emptied at it.

So saddle up and ride into the west, for there are countless problems to be solved and bounty to be had.
