Gary Keller, *[The One Thing: The Surprisingly Simple Truth Behind Extraordinary Results](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16256798)*, Jay Papasan Bard Press 2013 (Hardcover) ISBN: ="1885167776"

## My Review 4/5

Quick read that covers some of the highlights of personal growth. Summarized in a sentence. Find the one thing you can do today that aligns you to your long term goals. Rinse repeat.

Sounds a lot like the quality improvement by Deming.
