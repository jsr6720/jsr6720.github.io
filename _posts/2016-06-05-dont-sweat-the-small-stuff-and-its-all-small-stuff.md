## My Review 4/5

An alternative title could be "strategies for living a peaceful life" and while it would be more descriptive of the contents of the book, the original title is very effective at capturing my attention. <br/><br/>Two things I've learned from this book: your inbox will still be full when you die, and life is too short to sweat the small stuff. Think of any incident and think of it's importance in 1, 10, 100 years. The great majority of our daily interactions will be rendered moot by this analysis. See also 80/20 principle.
