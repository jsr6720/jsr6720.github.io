George Lakoff, *[Don't Think of an Elephant! Know Your Values and Frame the Debate: The Essential Guide for Progressives](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13455)*, Howard Dean, Don Hazen Chelsea Green Publishing 2004 (Paperback) ISBN: ="1931498717"

## My Review 5/5

Inspects how to have conversations around values and how people vote with their minds not their pocketbooks. How people frame ideas in their mind is how they interpret the world around them. Take a look at [The Undoing Project: A Friendship That Changed Our Minds](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35631386) or [Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1713426)
