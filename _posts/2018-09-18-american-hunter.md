Willie Robertson, *[American Hunter](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25110847)*, William  Doyle Simon  Schuster Audio 2015 (Audiobook) ISBN: ="1442388242"

## My Review 1/5

Didn't finish. Book was a collection of anecdotes about his personal life, uninteresting, and previous hunter's lives which barely scratched the surface of their rich history.

Moral: people who spend time outdoors are more 'rugged' than those who spend time indoors.
