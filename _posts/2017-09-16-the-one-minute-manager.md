Kenneth H. Blanchard, *[The One Minute Manager](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/558962)*, Eric Conger HarperAudio 2003 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="0060567503"

## My Review 3/5

Take aways:

Trust your people

Weekly status meetings to ensure progress

* One minute goal settings

* One minute praising

* One minute reprimands

Bottom line, Clear expectations drive clear results.
