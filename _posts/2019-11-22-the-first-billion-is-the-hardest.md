T. Boone Pickens, *[The First Billion Is the Hardest: Reflections on a Life of Comebacks and America's Energy Future](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10524770)*, Arthur Morey Random House Audio 2008 (Audio) ISBN: ="0739366572"

## My Review 4/5

Gather round for a story of riches lost and won. Not sure why the average is ~3 this is a great narrative that tackles history and future. Granted, I'm from Texas, Read [Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13372977), and Pickens reminds me of my own Grandfather.<br/><br/>Your mileage may vary, just make sure it's a clean burning natural gas transportation vehicle.
