S.C. Gwynne, *[Empire of the Summer Moon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7648269)*,  Scribner 2010 (Hardcover) ISBN: ="1416591052"

## My Review 4/5

Definitely worth the read of "things they don't teach in high school". An amazing look at the high plains tribes of Texas/Mexico/Oklahoma and all the challenges there within.

Amazing to think that the Comanche bands had stopped and pushed back westward anglo settlers for decades before the advent of modern day repeating rifles and disease. Great segue for [Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1842)
