## My Review 4/5

Definitely worth the read of "things they don't teach in high school". An amazing look at the high plains tribes of Texas/Mexico/Oklahoma and all the challenges there within.<br/><br/>Amazing to think that the Comanche bands had stopped and pushed back westward anglo settlers for decades before the advent of modern day repeating rifles and disease. Great segue for [Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1842)
