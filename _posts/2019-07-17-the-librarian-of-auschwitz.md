Antonio Iturbe, *[The Librarian of Auschwitz](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31216121)*, Lilit Å½ekulin Thwaites Macmillan Young Listeners 2017 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1427287074"

## My Review 5/5

Lightly fictionalized account of real events of the Holocaust. <br/><br/>Fantastic read and very heavy at times, unflinching in its accounts of the actual events in the camp.
