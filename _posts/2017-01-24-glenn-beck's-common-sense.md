Glenn Beck, *[Glenn Beck's Common Sense: The Case Against an Out-of-Control Government, Inspired by Thomas Paine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6478256)*,  Threshold Editions 2009 (Paperback) ISBN: ="1439168571"

## My Review 3/5

Picked this book up because I read an article about Beck's remorse over Trump's victory.<br/>Bonus: This book includes the original text of Thomas Pains Common Sense.<br/><br/>Here are my key takeaways:<br/><br/>* Back a politician not a party.<br/>* Use the tools of democracy to change the system. Violence is not needed<br/>* Redistricting as a political tool is killing democracy<br/>* Active informed citizens are required for a representative republic<br/><br/>
