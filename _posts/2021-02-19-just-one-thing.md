Rick Hanson, *[Just One Thing: Developing a Buddha Brain One Simple Practice at a Time](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11276139)*,  New Harbinger Publications 2011 (Paperback) ISBN: ="1608820319"

## My Review 5/5

Great volume that's worth a read and re-read. Focus in on the things to approach happiness by Letting Go and appreciating all the wonderful things in life.<br/><br/>While our neurons and evolution have wired us to see the negative in life. This makes for poor mental health. Focus on the positives and reduce stress.
