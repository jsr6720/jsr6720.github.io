David Eddings, *[Castle of Wizardry (The Belgariad #4)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/645023)*,  Del Rey 1984 (Mass Market Paperback) ISBN: ="0345335708"

## My Review 5/5

Picked this up from my childhood pile to give it a reread. I found all my favorite characters. One thing I do wish I could un-see though is all the similarities to other works of fiction in the same time period. All and all a great trip back in time.
