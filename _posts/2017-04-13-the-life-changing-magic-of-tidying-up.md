Marie Kond≈ç, *[The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23862127)*, Emily Woo Zeller Tantor 2015 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="149450894X"

## My Review 3/5

Aside from the gratuitous repetition of the book, here is what I took away before I could listen no longer:<br/><br/>1. Ask yourself "do I want it" not "shall I discard it"<br/>2. Hold it and ask "does it spark joy"<br/>3. Group by category not by location<br/>4. Don't discard things for other people<br/><br/>Honestly though this books seems to appeal to apartment dwellers of high socio-economic status that can afford to replace functional items at their leisure. Filed under "books that should have been a blog post".<br/><br/>-- post script --<br/><br/>I wanted to clarify in the weeks after I read this book that the concepts are solid. But the writing was poor. Perhaps she could have tidied her book as well as she tidies her clients homes.
