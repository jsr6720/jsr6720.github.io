Doris Kearns Goodwin, *[The Bully Pulpit: Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and the Golden Age of Journalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17571486)*, Edward Herrmann Simon  Schuster Audio 2013 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1442362626"

## My Review 4/5

**Abridged version of the book**

So picking this book up I hoped to learn a lot more about muckrakers and Roosevelt. Honestly though I felt the narrative focused too much on Roosevelt's accomplishments and life at the expense of a full history of investigative journalism.

Granted the one chapter about McClure's magazine was insightful but much of the book focused on the larger than life personality of Roosevelt. I did learn about Taft as well, but again while [Team of Rivals](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2199) had a much better narrative around Lincoln and Seward this book failed to convince me of Taft's and Roosevelt's friendship until the epilogue.

Still a good book, but reads more as a historical coverage not focused on journalism.
