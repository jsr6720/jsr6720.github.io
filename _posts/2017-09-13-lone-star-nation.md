H.W. Brands, *[Lone Star Nation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6890)*,  Books on tape 2004 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="0736699317"

## My Review 5/5

Great book that reminds me a lot of [David McCullough](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6281688) writing style. Especially [John Adams](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2203).<br/><br/>This book delves just deep enough into the anthropology/geologic/political history of spain/mexico/france to give a solid background of Texas without being overbearing.<br/><br/>All the heros are present and accounted for. Great book.
