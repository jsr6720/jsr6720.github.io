Roy F. Baumeister, *[Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11104933)*, John Tierney Penguin Press 2011 (Hardcover) ISBN: ="1594203075"

## My Review 3/5

Book is a little over the top with self-references. Middle of the book is a little slow but first few chapters and last few chapters definitely a good read.<br/><br/>Key concepts: eliminate temptation and frame the decision on future self vs past self.
