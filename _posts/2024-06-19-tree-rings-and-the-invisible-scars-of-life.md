## Preface

Originally, I hadn’t intended to publish anything online about my cancer, but I was inspired by [XKCD Cancer Comics](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/Category:Cancer) to share parts of my survivor’s journey. Besides, I think about cancer a lot[^think], and this site is called “James’s Thoughts”...

## Slice of life

At my local library[^slab] is a tree slab on display. You’ve seen them before. A cross-section of a local felled tree two or three hundred years old. The passage of time marked by growth rings; the stressful years hidden, invisible until the very end.[^rings].

I took this picture around four months after my most recent discharge from the hospital[^hope]. At the time, I did not know if my treatment was effective—if I had achieved remission (I had)—but as I stared at the tree, I felt a connection. A metaphor for my current state. This tree was once living, breathing, standing tall all while carrying the scars of challenging times within.

## The Scar I Carry

My cancer and subsequent treatments have left invisible scars on my life as well. Many of my physical symptoms have subsided. My appearance has been restored with another year of growth. But on the inside—after a brief moment of exposure—are all the signs of distress and turmoil.

During my chemo treatment, my nails developed a “fracture point”: a scar marking when all my cells turned over, most pronounced on my thumbs. Here I compare notes with the tree. This scar here—what did you see? Was it hard? What lessons did you learn?

If you can move forward, so can I[^status].

### Footnotes

[^slab]: Display at Seymour Public Library as documented by [West Side News](https://web.archive.org/web/20200303190726/https://westsidenewsny.com/features/2020-03-02/tree-slab-display-provides-a-slice-of-our-history/) 

[^rings]: I learned from a wonderful Radiolab segment called [The Fellowship of the Tree Rings](https://web.archive.org/web/20250103184931/https://radiolab.org/podcast/fellowship-tree-rings/transcript) that the study of [tree rings](https://web.archive.org/web/20240810050228/https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/tree-rings.htm) is called [dendrochronology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrochronology).

[^hope]: I had originally written “my final discharge from the hospital.” I hope that it is.

[^status]: As of June 2024, I’m alive and well; check out <https://status.jsrowe.com> to see what I’m up to.

[^think]: When I wrote this post it was just a few months after my treatment. I'm happy to say a year later Nov 2024 I think about cancer much less.
