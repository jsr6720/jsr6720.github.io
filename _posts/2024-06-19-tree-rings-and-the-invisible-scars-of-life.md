## Slice of life

At my local library[^1] is a tree slab on display. You’ve seen them before. A cross-section of a local felled tree two or three hundred years old. The passage of time marked by growth rings; the stressful years hidden, invisible until the very end.[^2].

I took this picture around four months after my most recent discharge from the hospital[^3]. At the time, I did not know if my treatment was effective—if I had achieved remission (I had)—but as I stared at the tree, I felt a connection. A metaphor for my current state. This tree was once living, breathing, standing tall all while carrying the scars of challenging times within.

## The Scar I Carry

My cancer and subsequent treatments have left invisible scars on my life as well[^4]. Many of my physical symptoms have subsided. My appearance has been restored with another year of growth. But on the inside—after a brief moment of exposure—are all the signs of distress and turmoil.

During my chemo treatment, my nails developed a “fracture point”: a scar marking when all my cells turned over, most pronounced on my thumbs. Here I compare notes with the tree. This scar here—what did you see? Was it hard? What lessons did you learn?

If you can move forward, so can I.

## Author's Note

Originally, I hadn’t intended to publish anything online about my cancer, but I was inspired by [https://xkcd.com/1141/](https://xkcd.com/1141/) to share parts of my survivor’s journey. Besides, I think about cancer a lot, and this site is called “James’s Thoughts”...

As of June 2024, I’m alive and well; check out [https://status.jsrowe.com](https://status.jsrowe.com) to see what I’m up to.
