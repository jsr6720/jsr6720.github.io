Harriet Lerner, *[Marriage Rules: A Manual for the Married and the Coupled Up](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12144326)*,  Gotham 2012 (Hardcover) ISBN: ="1592406912"

## My Review 5/5

I really enjoyed this books content and format. More so than any other book you can find 5 or 10 rules that really speak to you and work them with your partner. <br/><br/>This book ha a heavy emphasis on family of origin relationships and many other common pirfalls. <br/><br/>
