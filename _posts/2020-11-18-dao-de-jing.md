Lao Tzu, *[Dao De Jing: The United Version](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31497704)*, Yang Peng AmazonUs/INDPB 2017 (Hardcover) ISBN: ="1581771592"

## My Review 4/5

While you could read this in one sitting. Certainly thousand year old text deserves at least a second read through. 

Theme of non interference and humble through the captures. Compelling enough for a revisit.
