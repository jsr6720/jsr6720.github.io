Barack Obama, *[The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1120650)*,  RH Audio 2006 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="0739334085"

## My Review 4/5

I wish I had read this book before voting in the 2008 and 2012 elections. All of Obama's policies and broad ideas are laid plain in this book. If only it were a requirement for all politicians to write such a piece before running for office. We'd have a clearer picture and insight into the minds of our leaders.<br/><br/>The last chapter was especially touching and a true testament to the power of Michelle in the relationship and how along-side every great man is a great woman.
