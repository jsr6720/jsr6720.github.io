## Method editor search with wrap option


Can’t tell you how annoying it is that search in a method editor can only go forwards or backwards of the cursor.


On larger methods (greater than 80 lines) I’ve done searches for words thinking they’re not in that method because I forgot to position my cursor at the top or do a forwards and backwards search.


See my [feature request](http://forums.4d.fr/Post//4688233/1/) for this on 4D forums.
