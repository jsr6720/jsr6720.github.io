Bryce G. Hoffman, *[American Icon: Alan Mulally and the Fight to Save Ford Motor Company](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14557681)*, Pete Larkin Tantor Media 2012 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="145260813X"

## My Review 5/5

Great book that pairs well with your choice of book about the great financial crisis of 2008 (Big Short).<br/><br/>Author wastes no time digging deep into the story of Ford and it's turnaround.
