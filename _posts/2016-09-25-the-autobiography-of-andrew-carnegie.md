Andrew Carnegie, *[The Autobiography of Andrew Carnegie](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13591052)*, Antony Ferguson Tantor Media 2012 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1452607451"

## My Review 4/5

Fantastic book that covers the life of Carnegie and that of growing up in the turn of the 18th century.<br/><br/>Favorite parts included the discussion of steel making process and investing only to which one could afford. Carnegie saw several boom-bust cycles and was able to flourish through all times.<br/><br/>'Put the most selective eggs in one basket and watch them all flourish'. His attention to the craft of steel making and recognizing that vertical integration was key to profits made him a very wealthy man.<br/><br/>He was tough on laborers who did not honor their agreements, but was very fair when time came to negotiate terms.
