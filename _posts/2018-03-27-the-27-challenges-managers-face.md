## My Review 5/5

I loved this book. Matches my leadership style. Constant 1-1 face-face communication with the team. Pairs great with the book I'm reading now by Maxwell ([The 5 Levels of Leadership](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11225698)). Each chapter details a common management problem (gleaned from Gallup polls and 9000+ site visits by the author).
