Harvard Business Review, *[HBR's 10 Must Reads: The Essentials](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25789642)*, Peter F. Drucker, Clayton M. Christensen, Michael E. Porter, Daniel Goleman, Brad Sanders, Susan Larkin Audible Studios on Brilliance Audio 2015 (MP3 CD) ISBN: ="1511321474"

## My Review 3/5

Only 2 or 3 of these stories still feel fresh after 20 years. Specifically people and resources. Company and technology examples are very dated.
