Kelly McGonigal, *[The Willpower Instinct: How Self-Control Works, Why It Matters, and What You Can Do to Get More of It](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10865206)*,  Avery 2011 (Hardcover) ISBN: 1583334386

## My Review 5/5

Great 'every-person' book approach to the psychology of Willpower. I liked this book better than [Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11104933) even though this book directly quotes [Roy F. Baumeister](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/132685). This book has helpful end of chapter summaries and includes activities to help boost your desired outcomes.

Split into the "I will" and the "I want" and the "I won't" this book helped me understand all the ways to prepare for success when self-control is involved.
