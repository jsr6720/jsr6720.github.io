Kelly McGonigal, *[The Willpower Instinct: How Self-Control Works, Why It Matters, and What You Can Do to Get More of It](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10865206)*,  Avery 2011 (Hardcover) ISBN: ="1583334386"

## My Review 5/5

Great 'every-person' book approach to the psychology of Willpower. I liked this book better than [Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11104933) even though this book directly quotes [Roy F. Baumeister](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/132685). This book has helpful end of chapter summaries and includes activities to help boost your desired outcomes.<br/><br/>Split into the "I will" and the "I want" and the "I won't" this book helped me understand all the ways to prepare for success when self-control is involved.
