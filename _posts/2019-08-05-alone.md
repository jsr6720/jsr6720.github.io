Michael Korda, *[Alone](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36398011)*, John Lee Audible Studios on Brilliance Audio 2017 (MP3 CD) ISBN: ="1543674151"

## My Review 4/5

If you ever wonder what the Thief of Baghdad, or "That Lady Hamilton" had to do with WWII and the British defeat at Dunkirk look no further than this book.<br/><br/>Michael Korda weaves his personal narrative of 6-7 years old into the saga of WWII. Warning he comes from a pampered rich background and acknowledges this in the book. Not many boys had full time nannies and trans-Atlantic flights in the 40's.<br/><br/>Great book that covers the events leading up to the evacuation of Dunkirk including how both sides reacted to getting the British forces off the main continent.
