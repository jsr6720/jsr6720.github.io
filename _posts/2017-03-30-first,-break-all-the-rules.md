Marcus Buckingham, *[First, Break All the Rules: What the World's Greatest Managers Do Differently](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50937)*, Curt Coffman Gallup Press 1999 (Hardcover) ISBN: ="0684852861"

## My Review 5/5

Great book that challenges many of the assumptions about managing people.

Greatest contribution is the list of questions that guide great performers.

Do I know what is expected of me at work?

Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right? 

Do I have the opportunity to do what I do best everyday? 

... Many more

Remember that "average" is a long way off from a cluster of high-performers. Focusing on innate talent and train skills is the best way to accomplish great staff.
