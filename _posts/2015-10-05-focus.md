Daniel Goleman, *[Focus: The Hidden Driver of Excellence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17866386)*,  HarperAudio 2013 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="0062300288"

## My Review 3/5

Not as good or informative as his [Emotional Intelligence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26329) book. Lots of repetition. Seems like book could be one chapter. Focus. it's good for you. The second half of the book improves greatly.<br/><br/>Final thoughts, this book really warmed up after the second half. Visionary leadership depends on focus on execution.
