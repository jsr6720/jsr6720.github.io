Adele Faber, *[How to Talk so Kids Will Listen...And Listen So Kids Will Talk](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/998398)*, Elaine Mazlish Simon  Schuster Audio/Nightingale-Conant 2002 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="0743525086"

## My Review 2/5

I want to give the beneifit of the doubt since this is an abridged recording, however I felt that [Boundaries with Kids](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104887) and [Active Parenting Now](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1343214) are far superior choices to this book.

In short here are three lessons when dealing with primarily toddler and early elementary school aged children:

* Don't dismiss feelings

* Have the kid be an active participant in their world

* As better described in the boundaries book above. Allow kids to experience natural consequences over punishment.
