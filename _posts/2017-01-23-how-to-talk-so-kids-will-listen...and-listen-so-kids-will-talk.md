## My Review 2/5

I want to give the beneifit of the doubt since this is an abridged recording, however I felt that [Boundaries with Kids](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104887) and [Active Parenting Now](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1343214) are far superior choices to this book.<br/><br/>In short here are three lessons when dealing with primarily toddler and early elementary school aged children:<br/><br/>* Don't dismiss feelings<br/>* Have the kid be an active participant in their world<br/>* As better described in the boundaries book above. Allow kids to experience natural consequences over punishment.<br/>
