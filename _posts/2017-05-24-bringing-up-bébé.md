Pamela Druckerman, *[Bringing Up Bébé: One American Mother Discovers the Wisdom of French Parenting](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13504382)*, Abby Craden Random House Audio 2012 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="0449806979"

## My Review 4/5

I thought this book was a lot of fun, but there were moments of intense description that have nothing to do with being a parent, but more to do with becoming a mother.

If I had to summarize the book into a few succient points it would be:

* Don't let you child dictate your life

* Let your child wait from an early age

* Your child is capable of reasoning and morality at a very early age

* Be consistent and authoritative not dictatorship

Reminds me a lot of [Active Parenting Now](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1343214) but told in a conversational way.

Also by the end of the book I bought a baguette and was disappointed to find out it's just bread.
