Andrew S. Grove, *[High Output Management](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/324750)*,  Vintage 1995 (Paperback) ISBN: ="0679762884"

## My Review 5/5

Hard to believe this book was written in 1983! Everything is in here. Leading knowledge workers. Managing outside your domain of expertise. 

Interviewing performance reviews and matrix organizational hierarchies. Great book.
