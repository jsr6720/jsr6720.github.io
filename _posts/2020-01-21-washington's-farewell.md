## My Review 4/5

This book traces one printed 'speech' and its impact over the decades/centuries.<br/>For one man to attain the height of power and willingly part with it was unprecedented.<br/><br/>Warning, there is Lots of repetition of history as it traces the document and impact through founding and modern times.<br/><br/>My only caveat is the full text of the farewell is read as an appendix. Wish it was first.
