John P. Avlon, *[Washington's Farewell: The Founding Father's Warning to Future Generations](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32505860)*,  Simon  Schuster Audio 2017 (Audiobook) ISBN: ="1508234442"

## My Review 4/5

This book traces one printed 'speech' and its impact over the decades/centuries.

For one man to attain the height of power and willingly part with it was unprecedented.

Warning, there is Lots of repetition of history as it traces the document and impact through founding and modern times.

My only caveat is the full text of the farewell is read as an appendix. Wish it was first.
