Alfred Lansing, *[Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2185083)*, Simon Prebble Blackstone Audio Inc. 2008 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1433208180"

## My Review 5/5

A great reading of Shackleton's voyage through the antarctic. This accounting is so riveting it rivals any fictional hero book. Pairs well with  "River of Doubt" by Candice Millard
