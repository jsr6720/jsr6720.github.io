Bevin Alexander, *[How Great Generals Win](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11914590)*, James Slattery Blackstone Pub 1995 (Audio Cassette) ISBN: ="0786109092"

## My Review 4/5

Barred from a 4 based on it's overly dry approach to battle movements. Most interesting part of the book was footnotes on the evolution of battle and war technology. Would recommend to the right person.
