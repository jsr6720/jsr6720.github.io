## Apple’s Magic Mouse


First, I like the small form factor, and tracking is very accurate.


My favorite features: not having to ‘know’ where the tracking wheel is, swipes for going back and forth in safari (very helpful for documentation navigation).


My point of confusion: the mouse says it does not require any additional installation media, however once you pair the device with your computer, thats not all to it. Additional components have to be downloaded via Apple Software update.


Now this could be because I’m on 10.5.8 instead of 10.6.x but it was a short point of ‘huh?’ that could have been clarified with a simple “Run automatic update when pairing is complete”.


I also like not having to plug in a USB pairing device, and it shipped with batteries in it.


All in all, it’s a keeper.
