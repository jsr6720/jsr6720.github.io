## Apple’s Magic Mouse[^draft]

First, I like the small form factor, and tracking is very accurate.

My favorite features: not having to ‘know’ where the tracking wheel is, swipes for going back and forth in safari (very helpful for documentation navigation).

My point of confusion: the mouse says it does not require any additional installation media, however once you pair the device with your computer, thats not all to it. Additional components have to be downloaded via Apple Software update.

Now this could be because I’m on 10.5.8 instead of 10.6.x but it was a short point of ‘huh?’ that could have been clarified with a simple “Run automatic update when pairing is complete”[^jobs].

I also like not having to plug in a USB pairing device, and it shipped with batteries in it.

All in all, it’s a keeper.

## It Was Not, In Fact, A Keeper

I think I used this for less than a month before switching to a Logitech mouse which I have purchased in some form over the years. I currently use a Logitech MX Master 2S as my primary mouse. It is now 2024 and these Apple Mice still charge from the bottom[^verge].

## A Quick Look at Apple Mice

From left to right:

1. Before my time
2. My grandparents had an old mac in their office that had this style of mouse. Maybe elementary school?
3. I don't remember this curved one much, but I suppose I must've used it along the way.
4. The 'hockey puck' mouse. I remember never knowing which way was "up" trying to hold this mouse.
5. Ah, when clear plastic was the ultimate cool electronics.
