## Universal micro usb charger with unique housing

Just a huge pet peeve after switching phones over the weekend. Micro USB is supposed to be the new universal[^xkcd] charge/data transfer male/female connector for phones.

Great so lots of devices use micro usb for charging, but LG and Motorola use different style encasements, making chargers incompatible even though its the same micro usb male/female connectors.

Argh! the frustration.
