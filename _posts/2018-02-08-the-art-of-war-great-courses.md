Andrew R. Wilson, *[The Art of War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17203820)*,  The Teaching Company 2012 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1598038826"

## My Review 2/5

This professor is so full of himself he barely covered the material of the text.<br/><br/>If I hadn't read the book prior to the lecture series I wouldn't have had the slightest clue what he was referring to.
