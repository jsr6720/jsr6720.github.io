David Eddings, *[Queen of Sorcery (The Belgariad #2)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/587582)*,  Del Rey 1982 (Mass Market Paperback) ISBN: ="0345335651"

## My Review 5/5

Picked this up from my childhood pile to give it a reread. I found all my favorite characters. One thing I do wish I could un-see though is all the similarities to other works of fiction in the same time period. All and all a great trip back in time.
