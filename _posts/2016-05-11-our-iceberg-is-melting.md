## My Review 2/5

An 'ok' written fable about the perils of not changing. It expands on the format of [Who Moved My Cheese?](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4894) (author has a forward to this book) to include more specific methods to disseminating change. One thing I did not like about the book was it did not focus on the failings of change, or on the failures of change.<br/><br/>Whereas "Haw" from cheese book fate is unknown everyone in this fable gets a happy ending. Once nice thing was the author's interview and how this book grew from its principle works "Leading Change" and "Heart of Change". I've added both to my list.<br/><br/>The primary focus of these fables is to give a new language to discussing problems. It's not negative to make a joke correlating behavior between individuals and a character in a book. Key takeaways: secrecy breeds mistrust, first who then what - form a leadership team of the right people, know that circumstance is not who you are. Personally I think fables should be left to [Aesop](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12452).
