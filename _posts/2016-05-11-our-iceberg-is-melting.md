John P. Kotter, *[Our Iceberg Is Melting: Changing and Succeeding Under Any Conditions](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1234204)*, Holger Rathgeber, Oliver Wyman Macmillan Audio 2006 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1427200246"

## My Review 2/5

An 'ok' written fable about the perils of not changing. It expands on the format of [Who Moved My Cheese?](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4894) (author has a forward to this book) to include more specific methods to disseminating change. One thing I did not like about the book was it did not focus on the failings of change, or on the failures of change.

Whereas "Haw" from cheese book fate is unknown everyone in this fable gets a happy ending. Once nice thing was the author's interview and how this book grew from its principle works "Leading Change" and "Heart of Change". I've added both to my list.

The primary focus of these fables is to give a new language to discussing problems. It's not negative to make a joke correlating behavior between individuals and a character in a book. Key takeaways: secrecy breeds mistrust, first who then what - form a leadership team of the right people, know that circumstance is not who you are. Personally I think fables should be left to [Aesop](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12452).
