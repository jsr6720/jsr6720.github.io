## My Review 5/5

Decent book, middle 3rd is the best third. I now know why he is called the father of management books. He lays the foundations for Covey's work on effective habits and Goldsmith's interpersonal flaws.<br/><br/>First third was decent practices of effective managers. How the manager of the knowledge worker needs to create fulfilling work for individuals. How K.W. need outside stimulus to make it through life. Last third was very 'legacy' minded and touted grand visions of social society that works with private/public sector.<br/><br/>Another important concept, management by objective. Evaluate the performance of employees based on how they perform against the objectives they think they hold.
