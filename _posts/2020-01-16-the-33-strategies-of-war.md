Robert Greene, *[The 33 Strategies of War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20997)*, Don Leslie HighBridge Company 2007 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1598870912"

## My Review 3/5

After reading "48 Laws of Power" [Robert Greene](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/865) I picked up this book. Follows the same format as the former, but I didn't find it as compelling. The psychology of humans being more interesting than the tactics of battle.
