Basic Books, *[The Best Business Books Ever: The 100 Most Influential Management Books You'll Never Have Time To Read](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9500645)*,  Basic Books 2011 (Paperback) ISBN: ="0465022367"

## My Review 3/5

Already showing it’s age due to a conspicuous lack of big tech firms. This book has a handful of classics and a whole swath of “huh”? I do like the key concepts and was able to knock quite a few books off ‘the list’. Worth the checkout from the library.
