Mark Manson, *[The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33406322)*, Roger Wayne HarperAudio 2016 (Audible Audio) ISBN: =""

## My Review 3/5

First half of the book is great. Digresses in the second half. Very blunt language that is fortunately backed by science. Probably a few too many references to the author's sex life, but I'm guess he doesn't give a fuck about that.

Much preferred [The 80/20 Principle: The Secret to Achieving More with Less](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/181206) because the crutch of this book is 'find the few things that give you the most sustained happiness'. Pursue that over escalating dopamine hits. Definitely a book that ignores reality of systemic elevation of white young men in the technology industries.
