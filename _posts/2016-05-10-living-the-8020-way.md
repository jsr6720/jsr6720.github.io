## My Review 4/5

This was a lighter version of the [The 80/20 Principle: The Secret to Achieving More with Less](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/181206) and focuses on finding the things that you love and pursuing them. At only 130 some-odd pages a great read.<br/><br/>Geared for helping any individual achieve what they desire from life. A very casual read.
