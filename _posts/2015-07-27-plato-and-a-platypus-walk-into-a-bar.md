Thomas Cathcart, *[Plato and a Platypus Walk Into a Bar...: Understanding Philosophy Through Jokes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1615198)*, Johnny Heller Recorded Books 2007 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1428173765"

## My Review 2/5

Eh. This was 'ok'. Some good jokes, but not enough tying philosophy to the jokes.<br/>Would not recommend, but would not say don't read it.
