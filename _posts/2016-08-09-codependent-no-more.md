Melody Beattie, *[Codependent No More: How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2317502)*,  Recorded Books, Inc. 2005 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1419381229"

## My Review 3/5

Suppose someone told you that you are codependent. How would you respond? What does that even mean?

This book gives a good anecdotal history of the phrase and it's use.
