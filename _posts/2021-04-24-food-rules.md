Michael Pollan, *[Food Rules: An Eater's Manual](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17707668)*, Maira Kalman Penguin Books 2013 (Paperback) ISBN: 0143124102

## My Review 5/5

A quick afternoon read. This is a whimsical and fun look at the mindset shifts we can have to eat better.

Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. The illustrations add a nice perspective.
