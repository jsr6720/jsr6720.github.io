Michael Pollan, *[Food Rules: An Eater's Manual](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17707668)*, Maira Kalman Penguin Books 2013 (Paperback) ISBN: ="0143124102"

## My Review 5/5

A quick afternoon read. This is a whimsical and fun look at the mindset shifts we can have to eat better. 

Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. 

The illustrations add a nice perspective.
