## My Review 4/5

First. The book can be halved and/or skipped around if you favor one continent or another. Mann does a phenomenal job traversing the histories of a peoples who were wiped off the earth by diseases.<br/><br/>This book covers everything you wanted to know:<br/>* Were all native populations nomads? Emphatically no, most city centers were ravaged by diseases<br/>* Did natives 'live at peace' with their surroundings? No, by all accounts natives did just as much damage/conscious cultivation to their surroundings as any later white population<br/>* Do Americans owe their sense of liberty to the values of natives? By some accounts Yes. The culture shock of seeing libertarian values of equality was hard for Europeans<br/><br/>After reading this book I have a better understanding of 'the rest of the story'. I definitely would recommend to anyone who wonders about the past inhabitants.
