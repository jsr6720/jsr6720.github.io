Malcolm Gladwell, *[David and Goliath: The Triumph of the Underdog](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333713)*,  Little, Brown & Company 2013 (Audiobook) ISBN: ="1478978252"

## My Review 5/5

A collection of stories that evaluates the premise that all disadvantages don't also come with advantages.

Starting with David and Goliath Gladwell examines human's inability to grasp an inverted U curve. How too much of a good thing can cease to yield returns and actually travel back down the effective curve.
