Ajay Agrawal, *[Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38910346)*, Joshua Gans, Avi Goldfarb Harvard Business Review Press 2018 (Hardcover) ISBN: ="1633695670"

## My Review 4/5

Great overview of the current AI/Machine Learning landscape circa 2018.

Premise of the book is that AI can be evaluated via a framework of providing needs and by the types of data used to fuel the training, feedback and ongoing model needs.

Comes to the table with an Economics approach. If the cost of predicting something approaches zero, business will use it constantly. The nature of data builds a strong moat that can be hard to breach. This can favor the first mover.
