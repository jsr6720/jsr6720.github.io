## Joined Github


As I worked on some code for an open source project I wanted to learn Git for a variety of reasons.


So not only am I using it, but I also joined [Github](https://github.com/jsr6720/)


I am definitely a fan of the distributed nature of Git, and I love the error messages, very helpful. Thank you git for suggesting a common fix to probably a common problem.



```
$ git add
Nothing specified, nothing added.
Maybe you wanted to say 'git add .'?

```

vs



```
$ svn add
svn: Try 'svn help' for more info
svn: Not enough arguments provided

```
