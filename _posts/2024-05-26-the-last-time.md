## Is it the last time?

## A picture of young James

Here is a young me. Proudly holding one of my the stuffed animals from my childhood. This and a snowman stayed around with me I think all the way through college and maybe made it into my kids hands at some point. The bulls were big in the 90s, trust me.

## Crayons at an estate sale

I was at an estate sale and bought a couple boxes of crayons for $1. I noticed that one had a name on it and I think about the above quote or some variation of it I've seen on the interwebs. So many things in life happen a 'last' time and in the moment we're not always aware of that fact.

<div class="flex-row">

    <img src="/assets/posts-images/small-crayola-box-back.png" alt="small crayola box back" class="center-img img-stylish"/>
</div>

## J.c. James, whats the moral here

Cherish the time you have. There will be more firsts, but there will also be lasts. And yes, even this project will have one last `_post`. Just don't know when that'll be right this minute.

## Author's Note

[big crayola box](/assets/posts-images/big-crayola-box.png)

Not sure if there is an archivist in me, but it certainly can't take photos.

Mostly an excuse to stick an old photo of me online.
