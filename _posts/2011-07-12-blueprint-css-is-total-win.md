## Blueprint CSS is total win


Having not played around with CSS frameworks before I found this one very appealing.


Really, it accomplishes something I used to spend an inordinate time doing: creating a simple set of CSS rules that bring all browsers to a common level playing field.


My favorite aspect is the concept of 24 columns easily split into classes `span-x` where x is a number of columns.
