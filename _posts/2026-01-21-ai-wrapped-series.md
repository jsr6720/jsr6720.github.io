Frontier conversational large language models (LLMs) are the closest implementation of the fictional Star Trek [“Computer”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCARS) I’ve yet to experience. I compare my journey with AI to the evolution of CPUs to GPUs. 

Before AI, like CPUs, my work was linear and sequential. With AI—like GPUs— I can build and research concurrently while iterating on one idea, processing and triangulating multiple sub-tasks across multiple vectors with very little context-switching cost.

**AI can make you faster, but it doesn’t guarantee you’ll be more effective.**

But AI does not add hours to the day, eliminate opportunity costs, or change how humans work together. Business principles set out by Drucker, Grove, and [other authors](/bookshelf) focus on finding wedges that grow future results—not “how much code you write.”

## The Series

This series is a field report from the front lines: what it looks like to go all-in on AI as an engineering leader, what I've shipped, what didn't work, and what matters for the future.
