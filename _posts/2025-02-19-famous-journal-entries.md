## Famous Journal Entries

When I think about my writings, I think about famous journals that have persisted through time.

### The First Computer "Bug"

### Copper Complaint

Considered the oldest ‘customer complaint’ known.[^verizon]

### The Light Has Gone Out—Roosevelt

A more somber entry. But what a tremendous weight a single X on a page represents.

### The Birth of an Airline

Just a simple napkin and an idea.

### Memoirs and Diaries

*Diary of Anne Frank* maybe being the most famous. *[Ernest Shackleton's Diary of the Quest Expedition, 1921-22](https://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/archives/shackleton/articles/1537,3,9.html)* another.

[John and Abigail Adams](https://www.masshist.org/digitaladams/archive/letter/) letters come to mind.

### Family Roots

So many of the artifacts shown on *[Family Roots](https://www.pbs.org/show/finding-your-roots/)* include written document, newspapers and other announcements.

## Footnotes

[^guid]: <https://americanhistory.si.edu> gets it. I see you, Director Howard Hathaway Aiken. I had wondered if I was silly to include a guid in my files. I wonder no more.

[^verizon]: I can only laugh because I archived my own [Verizon Complaint](/_archive/2011-01-09-verizon-restocking-fee-is-not-a-penalty.md).
