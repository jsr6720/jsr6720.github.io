Brian Tracy, *[Get Smart: How to Think and Act Like the Most Successful and Highest-Paid People in Every Field](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28926233)*,  Your Coach In A Box 2016 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1469003481"

## My Review 3/5

An updated but not as impact-ful version of [Think and Grow Rich](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30186948). essentially banish the bad habits and replace with strong self-thought and wealth accumulating actions.
