Patrick Lencioni, *[Silos, Politics & Turf Wars: A Leadership Fable About Destroying the Barriers that Turn Colleagues into Competitors](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3420855)*,  Macmillan Audio 2006 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="159397860X"

## My Review 3/5

I don't like fables that are longer than Aesop. But I make an exception for Lencioni. Key takeaway: management needs to tackle projects as a team. And an organization of silos is a direct reflection of the leadership style of the executive team. If budgets and resources and allocations are all "us vs them" at the top. It reflects itself to the bottom
