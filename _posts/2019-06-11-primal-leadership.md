Daniel Goleman, *[Primal Leadership: Realizing the Power of Emotional Intelligence (Leading with Emotional Intelligence)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1785519)*, Richard E. Boyatzis, Annie McKee Macmillan Audio 2002 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1559277440"

## My Review 4/5

First half of this book is a great application of [Daniel Goleman Emotional Intelligence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26820420) in the workplace.

Second half of the book goes broader picture and a repeat of other books by Goelman.
