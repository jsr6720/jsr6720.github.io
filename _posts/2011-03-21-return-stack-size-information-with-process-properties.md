## Return stack size information with PROCESS PROPERTIES


See my [official feature request](http://forums.4d.fr/Post//5368969/1/).


When executing processes that have the potential to use a large amount of memory 4D recommends “allocating enough stack size to the process” to be sufficient to do the job.


Well how would we know that?


I propose adding two additional return variables to [`PROCESS PROPERTIES`](http://doc.4d.com/4Dv11.6/help/command/en/page336.html). Stack Size and Stack Utilized.


This would allow me to get a point in time measurement of what I allocated to the process and how much the process is currently using of that allocated stack.
