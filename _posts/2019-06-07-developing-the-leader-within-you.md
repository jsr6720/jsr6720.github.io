John C. Maxwell, *[Developing the Leader Within You 2.0](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35433815)*,  Thomas Nelson on Brilliance Audio 2018 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1543638066"

## My Review 4/5

An update to the original. I found that maxwell still has a great message. But I liked the first edition better. 

In a nutshell. Always be growing. Always be learning. 

Nothing meaningful or worthwhile happens by accident. Those journeys are always uphill.
