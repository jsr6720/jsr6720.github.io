## My Review 1/5

Disclaimer, I did not finish this work. In fact I was convinced this was published in early 2000's. The dated references to Yahoo, K-Mart and direct mail all turned me off. Only upon writing this review did I discover it was actually published in 2016! I picked this title as a safe author to try out `Libby` (see author's note below) and was left disappointed. I've been very happy with his other works such as *[Eat That Frog]({% link _posts/2016-03-03-eat-that-frog.md %})* and *[Management]({% link _posts/2019-06-07-management.md %})*.

Production quality is poor, it almost sounds like Brian Tracy is winging it in the recording booth revising his anecdotes as he goes along. I also discoverd that this *not* a ISBN published book but a seminar style recording. Hard pass.

## Author's Note

When I was working in-office and commuting I had roughly 90 min of time to devote to daily listening of audio books. Since I've been working remote my consumption of books has dropped precipitously, but I recently decided to give OverDrive another shot. Which I've now learned is [Libby](https://libbyapp.com).

I was immediately put off by having to place a "hold" on a digital good, but I'll leave this aside for now.

Brian Tracy, *Building Your Business Entrepreneurial Growth Strategies*,  Ascent Audio 2016 (AudioBook)
