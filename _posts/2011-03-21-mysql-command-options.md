## MySQL command options


So I use MySQL for testing from time to time and I always get frustrated at logging in via command line.


Is it option “P” or option “p”, “U” or “u”. Long story short I chuckled at the option for -U or `--i-am-a-dummy`. So if you can’t figure out how to log in, maybe you are just a dummy like myself.


Which itself is apparently is a synonym for option `--safe-updates`
