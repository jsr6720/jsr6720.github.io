## 4D ‘blank’ user locked record

This example was reproduced with 4Dv11.8 HF3. This requires 4D Server and 4D Client setup. I was unable to reproduce in a stand alone environment.

While working with SQL and 4D, sometimes records would show locked status of blank.

<img src="/assets/posts-images/4d-blank_user_locked.png" alt="4d record locked blank user" class=""/>

`[LOCKED ATTRIBUTES](http://doc.4d.com/4Dv12.2/help/command/en/page353.html)` returns `-1` for the process in addition to the ‘blank’ user process and machine. Even though the documentation says this means you are trying to load a deleted record, this example has an existing record.

There have been a couple of examples on the [4D tech mailing list](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.inug-4d.tech/109025) regarding blank locked records. The locked record appeared to manifest from the SQL engine not ‘letting’ go of the record.

In the following simplified example a SQL query updates a record in a table, which loads another record from another table in the trigger. If that record is not unloaded it remains ‘locked’. The only way I’ve found to unlock this record is to write a project method, make it available to SQL calls and load/unload this record. Regardless of how the ‘blank’ locked record manifest itself the `IsRecordLocked` should unlock it.

### Setup

[Table\_1]Field\_1 (is alpha)  

[Table\_2]Field\_2 (is alpha)

```
` the SQL code
Begin SQL
	UPDATE Table_1 SET Field_1='test' WHERE Field_1='a record'
End SQL

` [Table_1] trigger code
READ WRITE([Table_2])
ALL RECORDS([Table_2])
ONE RECORD SELECT([Table_2])
LOAD RECORD([Table_2]) ` this 'locks' it for SQL server
` without an UNLOAD RECORD it will stay locked
```

### Solution

```
C_TEXT($result)

` Using the SQL engine to LOAD and the UNLOAD the record works
Begin SQL

	SELECT {fn IsRecordLocked('Table_2','Field_2="test"') AS TEXT}
	FROM ODBCTest
	LIMIT 1
	INTO :$result

End SQL

ALERT($result)
```

			Else
				$returnText:="False" ` ie this is not locked, or was locked by sql engine
			End if
			UNLOAD RECORD($tablePointer->) ` this will free the locked status

			  `lets break the loop so we don't keep processing
