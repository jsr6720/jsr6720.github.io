## My Review 4/5

One thing I love about [David McCullough](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6281688) is his novels ability to weave a full picture of 3 generations around the principle figure. The only negative thing I can bring to say about this book is even abridged it's a snap shot of Theodore's life.<br/><br/>Coming off [The River of Doubt: Theodore Roosevelt's Darkest Journey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78508) and [The Bully Pulpit: Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and the Golden Age of Journalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17334495) this book provided a lot of background of the Roosevelt family.
