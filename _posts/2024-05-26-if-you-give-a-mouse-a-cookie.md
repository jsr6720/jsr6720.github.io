## My Review 5/5

I always liked this book, if only because I identified with its roundabout accomplishment of work. Cannot tell you how many times a trip to the tool bench or different class file resulted in another side-quest to complete.

## What is the lesson?

I think there is merit and efficiencies gained by getting a variety of things done in a semi-organized manner. So long as we bend towards our primary objective it seems that having a cookie with a glass of milk and sweeping the floor is worth the journey. Remember also the power of 'no' and that the Mouse does eventually sit and eat his cookie. With a glass of milk.

## The friends you made along the way

Part of my new objective with this github repository is to archive some of the things I see online that I enjoy. Years ago I read a post on the organizational sidequest[^sidequest] and how contributing to things along the way make for a better outcome.

I remember spending what felt like forever in Chapter 2 of Baulders Gate 2. Side quest after side quest. Not realizing that the groundwork of the rest of the game and my character's strength going into the end game was based on.

## Embrace Opportunities

Accept quests. Especially with the vigor of Quest Sprout.

Book cover image hotlink credit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_You_Give_a_Mouse_a_Cookie until I can find my copy to take a picture. I guess I have my own side quest now.

[^sidequest]: If you know what I'm talking about submit a PR! Drop me a line! It used primarily Diablo 2 as an example, but Baulders Gate also comes to mind.
