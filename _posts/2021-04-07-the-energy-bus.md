Jon Gordon, *[The Energy Bus: 10 Rules to Fuel Your Life, Work, and Team with Positive Energy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/81107)*, Ken Blanchard Wiley 2007 (Hardcover) ISBN: 0470100281

## My Review 2/5

Meh. A little too strong on the manifesting and lacks grit.

While its true that a positive attitude can improve things this book's fable lacks the punch of [Patrick Lencioni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Lencioni) and the tenacity of actual changes.

If you skip this book, the one good advice it has is identify your vision statement and focus on making it reality.
