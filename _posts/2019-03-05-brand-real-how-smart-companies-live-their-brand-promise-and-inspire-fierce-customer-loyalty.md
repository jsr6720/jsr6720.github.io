## My Review 4/5

Great overview of what it means to have a "brand" and how consumers interact with that brand.

A brand invokes a promise in consumers head and it builds equity when the experience exceeds the expectations of the consumer.

The best brands build an authentic character and lives out it's promise with its constituents. Chasing buzz-words or personality traits is a surefire way to misunderstand what it is to "brand" a product.
