## Full variable introspection in debugger window

Another pet peeve. When developing in 4D I can’t see past 254 characters in the debugger window.

So I have to either `Alert($some_really_long_string)` or write the data to file. Annoying.

Maybe I should start a twitter account for these minute frustrations[^update].

## EOF/Footnotes

[^update]: Note from my future self in Nov 2024, 13 years later. twitter is now `x` and no I never post to twitter/`x`. I seem to prefer the quite introspection of these hand rolled posts.
