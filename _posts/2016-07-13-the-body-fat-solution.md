Tom Venuto, *[The Body Fat Solution: 5 Principles for Burning Fat, Building Lean Muscle, Ending Emotional Eating, and Maintaining Your Perfect Weight](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6153032)*, L.J. Ganser BBC Audiobooks America 2009 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1602836248"

## My Review 5/5

This is a great a book that blends the life approach of "Think and Grow Rich" with the way the mind works with eating. Lots of good advice.<br/><br/>To say it only focuses on food, diet and exercise is selling the book short. Really dives deep on mindset needed for long term healthy living.
