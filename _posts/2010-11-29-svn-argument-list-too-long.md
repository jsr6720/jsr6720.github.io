## svn: Argument list too long


Recently I needed to add thousands of files to an existing repository, but every time I tried `svn add *` or the `svn import` functionality I got the error: 


`svn: Argument list too long`


I finally found help with [this link](http://www.arraystudio.com/as-workshop/how-to-add-multiple-files-to-subversion.html) but it did not work with file names with spaces.


So below I take the substring of the output in spaces and ? from the whole line before adding the file.



```
svn status | grep "^?" | awk '{ print substr($0,9,length($0))}' | while read f; do svn add "$f"; done

```

I’m sure more can be done to make this better, but this did the job I needed. For example using `ls` to import to svn would be helpful. For now this only works when `svn status` can be executed.


I think `find` is the best way to do this, with regex support; but again I just hacked my way to the finish line.
