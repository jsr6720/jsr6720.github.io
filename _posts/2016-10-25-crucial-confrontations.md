## My Review 4/5

Picks up on the concepts of [Crucial Conversations](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15014) and expands on how to start a difficult conversation. First two steps do not require any risk. Identify the true problem, and IF the conversation is worth happening.<br/><br/>I also liked the Content, Pattern, Relationship (CPR) approach to having conversations. One time infractions are content based, multiple pattern based and ultimately factor into whether or not to continue the relationship.<br/><br/>Breaking the pattern of silence or violence is going to require the use of empathy building. "Why would a rational reliable person choose to act this way?".  Also target change with the "Who will do What by When, follow up". The best thought leaders build rapport and positive interactions daily, so crucial confrontations are met with shared pool of meaning.
