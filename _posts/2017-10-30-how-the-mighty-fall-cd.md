James C. Collins, *[How the Mighty Fall CD: And Why Some Companies Never Give In](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6942991)*,  HarperAudio 2009 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="0061939234"

## My Review 3/5

Not as good as Collin's other work. This focuses on how companies fail<br/><br/>1. Hubris from success<br/>2. Pursuing too much opportunity at once<br/>3. Denial of reality<br/>4. Flailing for too much change<br/>5. Irrelevance, or death<br/><br/>Not really a focus on the innovators delima or stimulate the core as he describes in his other books.
