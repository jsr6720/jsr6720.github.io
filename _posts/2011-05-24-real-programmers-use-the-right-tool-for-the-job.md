## Real programmers use the right tool for the job

I was doing some light reading via Slashdot on [why guis suck revisited](http://www.infoworld.com/d/data-center/why-guis-suck-revisited-515). Reading the endless debate about graphical interfaces versus command line is like a political debate. Authors often frame the article to one spectrum end or another to entice response.

The myriad of examples back up a specific view point I’m going to say something totally uncontroversial: “real programmers use the right tool for the job”. This post title itself being a reference to [xkcd “Real Programmers”](http://xkcd.com/378/).

Yes we all know plenty of examples where a well placed `sed` saved the day. We also know when popping open an application and clicking a few buttons is much easier than writing individual commands.

Really, how many people do you know who use `mail` or `mutt` as a command line interface to their mail? How many people browse the internet using `links`? My approach to any problem is to find the right tool to accomplish the task. Sometimes this means going straight to the command line, other times it means interacting with a program via a graphical interface.

Real programmers have an arsenal of tools to get the job done and can identify the best way out of a problem.
