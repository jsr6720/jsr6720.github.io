Sandberg, Sheryl. *[Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16071777-lean-in)*. Random House Audio, 2013. Audiobook. ISBN 9780385394239 (ISBN10: 0385394233). Accessed via Libby.

## My Review 4/5

This book is an easy read, it is a combination of anecdotal stories and observations from Sandberg about how best to encourage and support women in the workforce. There are also cited studies and specific actions suggested to incorporate into your work practices.

On this mark it hits well, it is more polished and fleshed out than her Ted Talk[^ted]. There are some cited works that I was familiar with and others not. One especially important part of this book is that the more women (or any group, for that matter) are included, the less that group sticks out and the more it fits in. This is explored more in depth in [The Tipping Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tipping_Point) by Gladwell.

One study cited by Sandberg found that when comparing identical CVs with male and female names, both women and men adjusted their expectations to better fit the male candidate. She also pointed out that women are less likely to negotiate terms of employment and no one ever asks a man, "how he does it all". 

If there is one nit I have with the book is there is a suggestion that 1/3 of the answer lies with "getting the other half to do more". I'm not sure how this advices apples to a widow, divorcee or someone who's spouse travels months of the year. The other two suggestions, sit at the table and don't leave before you leave are learnable skills. One focuses on being present and the other on staying in the game.

Reading this book in 2024 feels especially poignant coming of the loss of Presidential candidates Clinton and Harris. Regardless of how you voted both Clinton and Harris have decades of leadership and political experience and to suggest otherwise is why I think Sandberg closes out her book with a call to continue to embrace and advance feminism as the equality of the sexes.

I do think reading this book is worthwhile for a woman's perspective as an accomplished business leader[^almost].

### Footnotes

[^ted]: I perceive that this book is the continuation of the high level thoughts presented in [TED Talk with Sheryl Sandberg: Why We Have Too Few Women Leaders](https://leanin.org/education/ted-talk-why-we-have-too-few-women-leaders)

[^almost]: I almost wrote "female" leader, but as Sandberg points out, we should be striving for a future where adjectives aren't necessary. Guess I still have work to do.
