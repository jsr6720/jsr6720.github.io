Kenneth H. Blanchard, *[The On-Time, On-Target Manager](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2722323)*, Steve Gottry, Brian Corrigan HarperAudio 2004 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="0060584823"

## My Review 2/5

Honestly, the book [Eat That Frog|95887] is a far superior book to this one.<br/><br/>I really didn't gain anything from this book other than a healthy dose of skepticism of the CEO (Chief Effectiveness Officer).
