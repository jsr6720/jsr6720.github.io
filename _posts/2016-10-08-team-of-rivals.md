Doris Kearns Goodwin, *[Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2202)*, Richard Thomas Simon  Schuster Audio 2005 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="0743539133"

## My Review 4/5

Good book that covers the years leading up to President Lincolns assassination. Though the title led me to believe this book would be more about cabinet decisions it was ultimately a discussion of how Lincoln balanced the various egos and political ambitions of those in his cabinet.

I wish it had spent a little more time on how the cabinet fared after the death of Lincoln. Still a good book.
