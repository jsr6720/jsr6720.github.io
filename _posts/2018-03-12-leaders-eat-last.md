## My Review 4/5

This book does not focus on strategic initiatives. It is a study of the history of mankind and how it's anthropology can be used with managing people.<br/><br/>Partly [A Brief History of Mankind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6567068) and [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377) Sinek makes the case that only by understanding how humans react physiologically to situations can we lead them.<br/><br/>If I had no background in mental models this would've been a 5/5. This book tries a bit hard to be everything to everyone. It has a deep history of how humans behave anthropologically and how to best serve a leadership position to the group. Key take-away. Better to be the servant and perform favors than to be the tyrant and demand action. This was a good book and my summary doesn't do it justice. Also added to my list by the same author [Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7108725)
