Ron Chernow, *[Alexander Hamilton](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/944986)*,  Penguin Audio 2004 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="0142800430"

## My Review 4/5

Abridged. Biggest let down was Hamilton's short life. Very good.<br/>Hamilton's role in a central bank and unifying the states into a strong nation was enlightening.
