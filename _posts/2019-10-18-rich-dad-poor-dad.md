Robert T. Kiyosaki, *[Rich Dad Poor Dad](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20918792)*, Tim Wheeler Rich Dad on Brilliance Audio 2014 (Audible Audio) ISBN: ="1491517824"

## My Review 3/5

I see what this is a classic, but towards the end it veers to close to "I've had a string of successes so can you!". Good read if you've read no other financial literature. Heavily focused on building wealth through real estate transactions and owning businesses.
