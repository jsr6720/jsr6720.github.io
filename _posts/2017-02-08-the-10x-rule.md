Grant Cardone, *[The 10X Rule: The Only Difference Between Success and Failure](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12345998)*,  Your Coach In A Box 2011 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1596599200"

## My Review 2/5

This book is a lot of yelling and not much substance.

See things like [book:Blue Ocean Strategy|4898] for a discussion on how dominating a sector is important.

See [book:The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People|36072] for how to be a better person.

See [author:James C. Collins|2826] for the flywheel concept.

It's hard to listen to a guy tell you that he would be more successful if he didn't' violate his own 10x rule. This author is not for me.
