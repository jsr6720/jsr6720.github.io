Judith Sills, *[The Comfort Trap: or, What If You're Riding a Dead Horse?](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5215642)*,  HighBridge Company 2004 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1565118472"

## My Review 5/5

Great book, but I feel that ratings skew to how much you can personally identify yourself in the patterns.<br/><br/>The best lesson learned is that the fear of change can keep us shackled in an unhappy situation long past it's prime. Be proactive on these situations and live life.
