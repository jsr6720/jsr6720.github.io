David McCullough, *[1776](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1941895)*,  Simon  Schuster Audio 2005 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="0743544234"

## My Review 3/5

Picked up another David McCullough book after reading [John Adams](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2203). This one was narrated by him and a bit more dry. His story-telling narrative doesn't work as well when not following one 'protagonist'.

It's also quite lengthy for only covering one year of history. I enjoyed better "The American revolution" by Guelzo, Allen C
