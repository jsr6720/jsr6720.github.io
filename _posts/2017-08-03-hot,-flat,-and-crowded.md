## My Review 2/5

This book takes WAY too long to say a few points. Could not finish, it felt like I was listening to the same chapters over and over again.<br/><br/>* Population growth is exponential (Crowded)<br/>* Science has determined that consuming fuels from hell is bad (Hot)<br/>* Globalization means there are fewer and fewer virgin resources to exploit for growth (Flat)
