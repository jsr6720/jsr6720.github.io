Malcolm Gladwell, *[The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/477780)*,  Little, Brown  Company 2007 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1600240054"

## My Review 3/5

A better book than the similar [Freakonomics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1202) or how do great changes in society follow a viral model of spreading and disbursement.

Social epidemics spread by connectors, mavens, and salespersons. This web of people is how information goes from niche to mainstream. Solid book. Good examples.

Super connectors - many connections to a world over. Think barber, or postman

Mavens - collect specific information. Think the guy who always seems to know the latest restaurant opening

Salesperson - sell new ideas to people

The law of the few (80/20 rule). Stickiness factor, something has to 'stick' for it to cause change. Power of context shows that humans are much more influenced by contex than by self autonomy
