Gretchen Rubin, *[Happier at Home: Kiss More, Jump More, Abandon a Project, Read Samuel Johnson, and My Other Experiments in the Practice of Everyday Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16309811)*, KÃ¤the Mazur Books on Tape 2012 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="0449014401"

## My Review 1/5

I'll save you the trouble. Read Benjamin Franklin Autobiography and his use of a virtues chart.<br/><br/>Everything else in this book is difficult to relate to as a common person. IE getting rid of 4 computers from my Manhattan apartment.
