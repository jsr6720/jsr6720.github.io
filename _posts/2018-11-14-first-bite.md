Bee Wilson, *[First Bite: How We Learn to Eat](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28153282)*,  Blackstone Audiobooks 2015 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1504657705"

## My Review 4/5

Great book that tracks eating habits from birth to adulthood.

Bottom line. Eating habits are learned and cultural. Some key takeaways

1. Kids have a 'flavor' palate window 4months to 7months so early food tastes are critical

2. It's never too late to change eating habits and behaviors

3. Family dinner time is still an incredibly important aspect of healthy eating habits
