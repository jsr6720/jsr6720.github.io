## My Review 4/5

Great book that tracks eating habits from birth to adulthood.<br/><br/>Bottom line. Eating habits are learned and cultural. Some key takeaways<br/><br/>1. Kids have a 'flavor' palate window 4months to 7months so early food tastes are critical<br/>2. It's never too late to change eating habits and behaviors<br/>3. Family dinner time is still an incredibly important aspect of healthy eating habits
