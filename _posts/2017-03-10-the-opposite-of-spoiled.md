## My Review 3/5

Spoiling children is only 1/4 material possessions. He started with a list by James Fogarty [book:Overindulged Children: A Parent's Guide to Mentoring|2831457]<br/><br/>spoiled children tend to have various things in common: <br/>1. They have few chores or other responsibilities, <br/>2. there aren't many rules that govern their behavior or schedules, <br/>3. parents and others lavish them with time and assistance,<br/>4. they have a lot of material possessions.<br/><br/>Beyond this quoting of the above book the narrative was 'ok'. True to journalistic fashion the language was good but seemed long for a book. I skipped through many of the chapters pertaining charitable giving.<br/><br/>The cover of the book gives away the meat of the story. Provide your children from an early age a stipend for work beyond required chores that they split into 'spend now', 'save for later' and 'give away' categories.
