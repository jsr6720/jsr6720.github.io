Matthew Syed, *[Black Box Thinking: Why Some People Never Learn from Their Mistakes - But Some Do](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24611735)*,  Portfolio 2015 (Hardcover) ISBN: ="1591848229"

## My Review 4/5

This is an incredibly long book that can be summarized in a few points:

* Collect data to make data-based decisions

* Watch out for the narrative fallacy

* Build a culture of learning from mistakes

If you've read [Good to Great](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76865) or [Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/522525) or [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377) you've been exposed to a lot of the stories and anecdotes of this book.

Other key concepts include cognitive dissonance, fundamental attribution error and breaking ambitions goals into discrete measurable chunks.

All in all, a good book.
