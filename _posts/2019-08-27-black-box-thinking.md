## My Review 4/5

This is an incredibly long book that can be summarized in a few points:<br/>* Collect data to make data-based decisions<br/>* Watch out for the narrative fallacy<br/>* Build a culture of learning from mistakes<br/><br/>If you've read [Good to Great](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76865) or [Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/522525) or [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377) you've been exposed to a lot of the stories and anecdotes of this book.<br/><br/>Other key concepts include cognitive dissonance, fundamental attribution error and breaking ambitions goals into discrete measurable chunks.<br/><br/>All in all, a good book.
