## My Review 4/5

Good book. Not mind blowing awesome like [The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/849380), but still good.<br/><br/>In a nut-shell<br/>1. Words of affirmation - tell your spouse you love them<br/>2. Quality Time - spend 100% time with your spouse<br/>3. Gifts - buy make or procure things for your spouse<br/>4. Acts of service - do things for or around your spouse<br/>5. Physical touch - not just the sexy time, all the small moments<br/><br/>Bottom line love your spouse often and in their primary love language, but spread the love through all the qualities. Work with spouse to figure out their love language and tell them what your primary one is.
