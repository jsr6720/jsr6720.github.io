## What Counts as Writing?

Call it a memoir, journal, diary, or even a memo pad. (Do GitHub [commit messages](https://github.com/jsr6720/jsr6720.github.io/commit/ff563a45470e49ccad10ff3ae85de08c9647cb89) count?) Writing is the very essence of an idea wrought to life. The smallest scribed note can persist through history in both humorous and unintended ways.[^atrocities] 

What is it about humans that resulted in the one of our ancestors to raise a [hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting#/media/File:SantaCruz-CuevaManos-P2210651b.jpg) and leave their mark? Was it their rock? Their home? Were they bored? Consumed in ritual? For the lulz?

## Why Do I Write?

I write as a means of reflection, thinking, relaxation and planning. By writing, I can clarify my thoughts; I write for the joy of writing, and rewriting, and ultimately publishing some small subset of those thoughts for others. 

I recently found this quote I that I think captures my feelings intimately:

> Writing a blog on your own site is a way to escape all of that(social platforms). Plus your words build up over time. That’s unique. Nobody else values your words like you do. – [Matt Webb]( https://interconnected.org/home/2025/02/19/reflections)

## So What Is This Site?

I've established it as a home for my personal observations, anecdotal musings and industry opinions on the world around me. Before this site, I felt my thoughts were strewn [across](https://github.com/jsr6720/goodreads-csv-to-md) the [interwebs]( https://github.com/jsr6720/wordpress-html-scraper-to-md) on various platforms[^oatmeal].

I figured if I can't remember my login to <https://txcowboycoder.wordpress.com> and LinkedIn never resurfaces [my articles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jsr6720/recent-activity/articles/) , I can assert ownership of writings [here]( https://github.com/jsr6720/jsr6720.github.io). Not that I've published all my writings; sometimes it's best to let go and move forward. I also enjoy being able to pinpoint exact moments in time I [discovered something new](https://www.jsrowe.com/joined-github/index.html).

## Denting the Universe

If Steve Jobs [dented the universe]( https://web.archive.org/web/20211005125353/https://www.macworld.com/article/214642/steve-jobs-making-a-dent-in-the-universe.html), then why not my observations of his dent? I was here. I saw.

To etch a singular micron in the Voyager golden records[^voyager] of humanity, is a fun thought. “But James, digital[^xkcd] will go poof one day.” I know. Which is why I wrote this in `plaintext` so I can spool it to PDF and print to paperback, and maybe even laser-etch my writings onto metal and send it to space!

### This Site as Training Data for LLMs  

Should this site be used as a source for training data? I feel like the series *Black Mirror* has a number of episodes that cover this; [“Be Right Back”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Right_Back) comes to mind. But as predictable as the human species might be in aggregate, I still think that individually, we are irrational agents[^irrational] and thus unique.

Or at least until LLMs figure out my humor.

### Significant Revisions

- {{ "2025-02-18 01:47:56 -0500" | date_to_string: "ordinal", "US" }} I originally wrote this when I wasn’t sure the purpose of this site. Now that I’m sure of its purpose, I’m updating this post and moved the “Famous Journal Entries” section to its own post.
- {{ page.date | date_to_string: "ordinal", "US" }} Originally published on [{{ site.url }}]({{ site.url }}) with uid {{ page.uid }}

### Footnotes

[^atrocities]: For this post, please allow me to set aside serious works documenting atrocities. These deserve their own preservation and study far beyond any of my personal musings.

[^irrational]: Most of my understanding of irrational humans comes from [Dan Ariely](https://web.archive.org/web/20240402003230/https://danariely.com/books/), but also [SMBC web comics](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/rational-2) by [Zach Weinersmith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Weinersmith).

[^oatmeal]: Matthew Inman really nails platform fatigue in [cartoon form]( https://theoatmeal.com/comics/reaching_people)

[^voyager]: I think it’s fascinating that someone had to decide what to add to the [golden record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record). If the digital landscape is infinite, will this one day get picked up by a planetary life scan? "No signs of intelligent life, Captain." Ha! I definitely do write some things for the lulz.

[^xkcd]: For posterity I’ve cropped my own version of [XKCD 1683](/assets/posts-images/xkcd-digitial-data-jrowe.png).
