Terry Brighton, *[Patton, Montgomery, Rommel: Masters of War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7351831)*, Mel Foster Tantor Media 2009 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1400114977"

## My Review 4/5

Hard to summarize three great generals into one book. This one seems to do everyone justice. Coming away with a better appreciation for the commanders to fought the wars.<br/><br/>Check out the epilogue for summarized leadership lessons. Specifically in the will to fight and the means to fight.
