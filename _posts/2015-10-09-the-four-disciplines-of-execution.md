Stephen R. Covey, *[The Four Disciplines of Execution](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/935736)*, Jennifer Colosimo Covey 2004 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1929494777"

## My Review 3/5

Workshop series, poor format for audio book. Got some cool worksheets out of the deal.

Focus on the Wildly Important Goals (WIGs) to successfully convert lofty goals into concrete actions.

Only the introduction is by Covey so that was a bit of a let down.
