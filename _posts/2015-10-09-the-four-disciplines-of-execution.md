Stephen R. Covey, *[The Four Disciplines of Execution](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/935736)*, Jennifer Colosimo Covey 2004 (Audio CD) ISBN: ="1929494777"

## My Review 3/5

Workshop series, poor format for audio book. Got some cool worksheets out of the deal.<br/>Focus on the Wildly Important Goals (WIGs) to successfully convert lofty goals into concrete actions.<br/><br/>Only the introduction is by Covey so that was a bit of a let down.
