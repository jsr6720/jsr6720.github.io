## 4th Dimension v11


The majority of the time I am programming in 4D (www.4d.com). While I’m unsure as to the market penetration in the states, it is evidently a very popular system in it’s native country France.


As a developer I mostly have gripes about the system, but I’ll try to mention merits from time to time.
