## About

Currently I develop with 4D, PHP, Flex, ruby, python, java and anything else that can solve my problems. I started this blog to write about 4D. Don’t worry if you’ve never heard of 4th Dimension proprietary database software, you’re not alone.

Most, if not all, of my posts are the results of on-the-job problem solving. I’d be happy to join you on your problem solving adventures; just drop me a line.

I started this blog before I became aware of the negative connotations of being a ‘cowboy’ coder. I pursue the highest coding standards possible working with a set of principles to guide my work.

[Cowboy Code](https://web.archive.org/web/20110808171244/https://www.cowboyethics.org/TenPrinciples.php).

1. Live each day with courage
2. Take pride in your work
3. Always finish what you start
4. Do what has to be done
5. Be tough, but fair
6. When you make a promise, keep it
7. Ride for the brand
8. Talk less and say more
9. Remember that some things aren’t for sale
10. Know where to draw the line
